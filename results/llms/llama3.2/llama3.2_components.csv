CVE-2025-28914,"A: 

This CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score prediction is based on a general understanding of Common Web Application Scanners and Exploit Tools, as well as the typical threat models for web applications. The AV (Attack Vector) component describes how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

Given the description of CVE-2025-28914, which states that ""anywhere"" allows Stored XSS, this indicates an attack vector that is adjacent to the system, implying that the system does not provide a secure boundary between untrusted input and sensitive data. This could be achieved through various methods such as client-side scripting, allowing the attacker to inject malicious scripts into the system without needing access to the underlying server.

A: Local or Adjacent could both apply in this case, as the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code from anywhere within the application. However, given that ""anywhere"" affects the login form to a specific range (from n/a through 0.2), it is reasonable to classify the attack vector as adjacent.

Therefore, A seems like the most fitting classification for this CVSS AV component, indicating an attack vector where the vulnerability allows an attacker to launch the exploit from locations next to or in the vicinity of the application's input.",AC:H,L  ←,UI:N,S:C,C:L,I:N,A:H

To predict the value for the A (CVSS 3.1) metric, you would typically follow these steps:


1. Read and understand the CVE description: The first step is to thoroughly read and comprehend the CVE description provided. This will help you grasp the nature of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it might affect different systems or applications.


2. Identify the Impact: Determine the severity of the impact the vulnerability has on the targeted system(s) or application(s). Factors such as data loss, system availability, integrity, confidentiality, or any other critical aspects should be considered.


3. Assess Functionality: Analyze whether the vulnerability affects only one function (Low), multiple functions (Medium), or all functions (High). The scope of the impact can significantly affect the CVSS score.


4. Identify Privileges Needed: Determine if privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, and their level. High privileges imply a more dangerous scenario than those requiring low-level access.


5. Determine Exploitation Method: Assess the ease with which an attacker can exploit this vulnerability. Methods that require manual interaction or significant planning might score lower than those easily exploitable by automated tools.


6. Data in Scope: Identify if sensitive data is involved, affected, or created as a result of exploiting the vulnerability. Data loss or exposure often increases the CVSS score.


7. Reference to Tools or Techniques: Determine if any specific tools, exploits, or techniques can be used to exploit this vulnerability. The existence and sophistication of these tools might influence your assessment.


8. General Public Exposure: Consider how widely the vulnerability is known and whether exploiting it poses a significant risk to general public use systems without requiring any special permissions or credentials beyond basic access rights.


Based on this information, you would then map your findings onto the CVSS scoring guidelines for the ""Attack Vector"" (A) component:


- **None (N)**: The attack vector does not exploit a vulnerability in the product.
  
- **Low (L)**: An atypical or unusual network location is used to reach the vulnerability, which could be considered less common, but still impactful.

- **High (H)**: An exploit exists on most systems, either by default or with minimal configuration changes."

To predict the CVSS AC component for a given CVE, follow these general guidelines:


1.  **Identify the type of vulnerability**: Is it a remote code execution (RCE), buffer overflow, SQL injection, or another type?
2.  **Assess the attack vector**: Is it an Attack Vector of Network (N), Local (L), or Adjacent (A)?
3.  **Evaluate the privilege required**: Does the attacker need administrative privileges, or can they exploit with user privileges?
4.  **Consider the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability**:
    *   Confidentiality: Is sensitive data exposed or accessible to unauthorized parties?
    *   Integrity: Are critical system components compromised?
    *   Availability: Can the system be used by authorized users?
5.  Based on your assessment, select the appropriate CVSS score for each component:

    *   **Attack Vector (AV)**:
        *   N (Network): Remote
        *   L (Local): Local
        *   A (Adjacent): Adjacent
    *   **Privilege Required (PR)**:
        *   0 (None): No privileges required
        *   1 (Low): Low-level system user or low-privileged user
        *   2 (High): High-privileged user or administrative credentials

CVE-2025-31433,"A:X

Note: Given the description, this vulnerability can affect adjacent networks, as it involves a web-based application that allows users to execute arbitrary code. The 'Cross-site Scripting' vulnerability suggests an attack vector that affects adjacent networks (web servers) where the vulnerability is present.

Here's reasoning for this prediction:

1. Vulnerability Type: The CVE describes a Cross-Site Scripting issue which typically allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, often affecting user sessions and potentially leading to data theft or further attacks.
2. Network Exposure: This vulnerability can lead to attacks that happen within the same network as an application running on it (adjacent), especially considering how common XSS is used for lateral movement and privilege escalation in networks.
3. Physical Access Not Required: Given the context of a web-based issue, there's no need to worry about physical device access; attackers primarily use web interfaces to exploit this type of vulnerability.

This prediction categorizes the CVSS AV metric as 'Adjacent' since it implies an attack vector that can be executed from within the same network where the vulnerable application is running.",AC:H,L  ←,UI:N,C  ←,C:H,I:N,A:L
