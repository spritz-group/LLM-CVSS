The provided CVE description indicates that it is related to an ""Authorization"" vulnerability in the WP Performance Pack software. To determine the appropriate CVSS vector for this issue, consider the following factors:

1. Attack Vector: Since there's no mention of remote access or proximity, a reasonable assumption could be that this is not an Adjacent (A) or Physical (P) attack but might lean towards Local (L).
2. Attack Complexity: Missing or incorrectly configured authorization levels could fall under ""High"" complexity due to the potential for exploitation.
3. Privileges Required: The nature of the vulnerability suggests that high privileges are required to exploit it.
4. User Interaction: This seems to be a server-side vulnerability, which implies no user interaction is necessary to exploit.
5. Scope: Given the lack of details on affected system versions or configurations, ""Unchanged (U)"" could be an initial assumption for scope, but a more precise assessment may require additional information about specific systems or configurations that are impacted by this vulnerability.

AV (Attack Vector) - Network (N), since this vulnerability could be exploited over a network.

AC (Attack Complexity) - High (H), due to the complexity of dealing with varying system response times during login and the potential for timing attacks.

PR (Privileges Required) - None (N), as an attacker does not necessarily need any special privileges or access to exploit the issue at hand, given it relates more to how system responses are handled rather than directly leveraging existing permissions.

UI (User Interaction) - None (N), because while user interaction is required for exploiting this vulnerability, the nature of the attack doesn't necessitate an active participation from a user beyond merely providing login credentials.

S (Scope) - Changed (C), due to the fact that the issue causes system response times to vary based on whether the provided credentials match existing records in the system, potentially affecting performance and usability.

C (Confidentiality) - High (H), because if an attacker gains access to this vulnerability, they can learn sensitive information about users such as passwords or account status without needing to decrypt it, just by knowing when their login attempts are likely to be accepted based on timing discrepancies.

I (Integrity) - None (N), since the primary concern isn't data integrity but rather the confidentiality of user credentials and system behavior in relation to these credentials.

A (Availability) - High (H), because if successful, an attacker could cause the system to become unusable due to the variability in response times, potentially leading to denial-of-service conditions for legitimate users.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-30344 is:

CVE-2025-30535,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-30535 based on the provided description, we can follow these steps:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** Given that this is a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability, it implies an attack vector of ""Network"" since it involves requesting and manipulating data from another network without needing physical access.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** Without more detailed information on the complexity of exploiting or generating a request to trigger the CSRF issue, we default to a typical high attack complexity for this type of vulnerability.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):** Since it's a remote vulnerability, requiring no specific privileges to exploit, ""None"" is appropriate.

4. **User Interaction (UI):** CSRF vulnerabilities typically require user interaction as they rely on tricking the victim into executing an unintended action.

5. **Scope (S):** This is unchanged from default since the vulnerability description doesn't specify any modifications or changes to the system that would affect its scope.

6. **Confidentiality (C):** Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities generally impact confidentiality by allowing unauthorized access to data.

7. **Integrity (I):** While CSRF itself does not directly affect data integrity, since it relies on user interaction and potentially manipulating actions rather than altering or deleting data, it's considered low for this aspect due to the lack of direct manipulation or alteration of data.

8. **Availability (A):** This vulnerability doesn't inherently impact availability since it primarily involves a client executing an unintended action without directly affecting system uptime.

CVE-2025-30557,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-30557, we need to identify the vulnerability characteristics based on the provided CVE description.

Given information:
- Vulnerability type: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Assumptions and deductions:
- AV: Adjacent (A), as CSRF attacks can occur when an attacker tricks a user into performing an action without their consent.
- AC: High (H) because creating and executing malicious requests on the server side requires some planning, manipulation of information, or exploitation of vulnerabilities.

Privileges required:
- PR: None (N), since no access control is needed to create or exploit a CSRF attack.

User Interaction:
- UI: Required (R), because the user must interact with the system in order for the vulnerability to be exploited.

Scope:
- S: Changed (C), as this vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to modify data that they should not have access to, thus affecting the scope of potential impact.

Confidentiality:
- C: High (H), as sensitive information may be accessed or modified by the malicious request.

Integrity:
- I: High (H), since the data being tampered with is considered valuable and potentially confidential.

Availability:
- A: None (N) is not applicable in this context, but we use High (H) to account for the potential impact of successful exploitation on system functionality or availability.

Based on these deductions, here's the CVSS 3.1 vector:

CVE-2025-30559,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-30559, we first need to break down its characteristics based on the provided CVE description:

- **AV:** Adjacent (A) - This is because the vulnerability affects local storage on a web page which can be accessed via an adjacent network. The impact of being ""Adjacent"" is that it doesn't require any specific attack vector but utilizes existing system configuration.

- **AC:** High (H) - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation indicates high complexity in terms of input validation and sanitization, leading to a high attack complexity.

- **PR:** High (H) - This is due to the need for privileges to use and manage local storage on web pages which can pose a significant threat if not handled correctly.

- **UI:** Required (R) - User interaction is necessary here as it involves storing user input in a way that makes users susceptible to XSS attacks. Thus, interaction with the system by the attacker is crucial.

- **S:** Changed (C) - The vulnerability affects storage capabilities or user data which is then exposed to unauthorized use, indicating a change in security posture post-exploitation.

- **C:** High (H) - Confidentiality of sensitive user information is at risk as malicious scripts can execute and access this data, leading to high confidentiality impact.

- **I:** High (H) - The integrity of user data stored locally can be compromised with XSS attacks leading to a significant loss of control over the system’s operation.

- **A:** High (H) - This indicates that availability of the system could be impacted if malicious scripts gain access, as they might consume excessive resources or even cause the server to crash under an extremely heavy load.

Now, combining these components into the standard CVSS 3.1 format gives us:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"
CVE-2025-30560,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we must analyze it and extract the relevant information:

- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), indicating an Attack Vector of Adjacent (A).
- There's no specific mention of privileges required or user interaction, so we can assume None (N) for PR and UI.
- Given that this issue affects multiple versions of jQuery Dropdown Menu without specifying any changes to the scope, it is Unchanged (U) for S.
- As the issue involves a Stored XSS vulnerability affecting confidentiality, the appropriate value is High (H).
- There's no mention of integrity concerns in the description; hence, we select None (N) for I.
- The availability of this feature isn't mentioned, so we default to None (N).

CVE-2025-30768,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE (CVE-2025-30768), let's break down the components according to the given criteria:

1. **AV: Attack Vector**: Given that this is a web vulnerability allowing Stored XSS, it implies that an attacker can inject code into web pages without needing network access or any specific privileges, but rather by simply accessing the web application itself.

2. **AC: Attack Complexity**: The complexity of attacking a web application for Stored XSS usually involves manipulating HTTP headers or body content to bypass security features such as Content Security Policy (CSP) or similar measures. This can be relatively straightforward with proper knowledge and manipulation techniques, indicating an attack complexity of High.

3. **PR: Privileges Required**: For this vulnerability, no special privileges are required for an attacker to exploit it since the vulnerability is a result of poor web application security practices rather than exploiting system or network vulnerabilities directly.

4. **UI: User Interaction**: While some Stored XSS attacks may require user interaction (for example, if a user must click on a link to execute the malicious JavaScript), many can be executed without user interaction by simply accessing the vulnerable website, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Thus, this is often classified as None.

5. **S: Scope**: This refers to how widely the exploit affects other components or data in the environment. For Stored XSS vulnerabilities, especially those affecting the generation of web pages based on user input, it's common for the impact to be within the scope of the affected application itself since the attacker does not have access to network resources and relies on the web application's internal vulnerabilities.

6. **C: Confidentiality**: This component indicates how much data confidentiality is impacted by a vulnerability. Stored XSS typically compromises the confidentiality of user data stored or transmitted through the web page, thus impacting it as High.

7. **I: Integrity**: The integrity refers to whether the vulnerability can be used to modify data in an unauthorized way without accessing system files directly. For Stored XSS, this vulnerability impacts the integrity by allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that can potentially modify user interactions with sensitive parts of the web application's functionality.

8. **A: Availability**: This component is about how much a vulnerability affects the availability or performance of critical system components. In the context of web applications and Stored XSS vulnerabilities, while the immediate impact on availability might be less direct (the web application remains accessible but potentially compromised), it's reasonable to consider the overall potential for denial-of-service scenarios due to resource exhaustion from executing malicious scripts.

Given these considerations:

- AV: Adjacent
- AC: High
- PR: None
- UI: None
- S: Unchanged

CVE-2025-30854,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-30854 based on your description and instructions, we'll need to break down the information provided into the components required by the CVSS 3.1 scoring system:

1. **AV (Attack Vector):** Given that this is a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability affecting remote users through the web, it falls under the category of **Adjacent (A)**.

2. **AC (Attack Complexity):** While the description mentions ""Cross Site Request Forgery"" without detailing the complexity of exploiting this flaw in the vulnerabilities' description or details provided, for the purpose of this exercise and following standard guidelines on attack complexities in similar issues, we'll classify it as **High (H)** due to its nature being about manipulating user behavior.

3. **PR (Privileges Required):** The vulnerability's impact suggests that it doesn't require special privileges to exploit but rather leverages existing permissions due to the nature of how user interaction is manipulated on a website, so we categorize this as **None (N)**.

4. **UI (User Interaction):** Given that Cross-Site Request Forgery exploits the trust of users in executing actions they didn't intend, we classify it as **Required (R)** because there needs to be some form of user interaction for this type of attack to succeed.

5. **S (Scope):** Since this vulnerability affects data on the same origin and is not about accessing or altering data from different origins (which would change the scope), we categorize it as **Unchanged (U)**.

6. **C (Confidentiality):** This is a Cross-Site Request Forgery issue, which directly attacks user's session cookies and potentially other sensitive information without encryption in transit or storage, making it at least **High (H) in terms of Confidentiality Impacts**.

7. **I (Integrity):** Similar to confidentiality, this attack impacts the integrity of user data since malicious actions are executed by the victim’s own browser due to their interaction with a manipulated website request, which should be categorized as **High (H)** in terms of Integrity Impacts.

8. **A (Availability):** Given that successful execution would likely result in loss of functionality for the affected users while not necessarily leading to data breaches but still impacting the user experience and service availability, we classify this as **Low (L) in terms of Availability Impacts**, understanding that while it might be more impactful to the users' perception of service reliability than actual data security.

Based on these considerations, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-30854 would be:

CVE-2025-30898,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-30898 based on the provided description, let's break down the components:

1. **AV (Attack Vector)**: Given the nature of a Stored XSS vulnerability allowing an attacker to inject scripts directly into the application without needing user interaction, this would be classified as **Adjacent**.

2. **AC (Attack Complexity)**: The attack complexity for such a stored XSS issue is generally considered to be **High** due to its ease of execution and potential impact on confidentiality.

3. **PR (Privileges Required)**: Since the vulnerability does not require elevated privileges or special permissions beyond what's typically needed to use the web application, it falls under **None**.

4. **UI (User Interaction)**: This is **Required** because an attacker must interact with the application for the XSS attack to be effective.

5. **S (Scope)**: The scope of a stored XSS is generally considered to be **Changed**, as the injection allows the attacker to execute malicious scripts, impacting confidentiality and integrity on every request that's processed in the context of this vulnerability.

6. **C (Confidentiality)**: Given the ability to inject arbitrary code and potentially steal sensitive information or hijack user sessions, this would be considered a **High** threat.

7. **I (Integrity)**: The potential for an attacker to alter or delete data could lead to a breach of integrity, thus it's classified as **High**.

8. **A (Availability)**: While the availability might be affected in terms of user experience with malicious scripts executed on the client-side (though not directly due to server-side storage), the primary impact is on confidentiality and integrity. However, considering the broader implications of XSS on the system's usability, it could also imply an availability issue indirectly.

CVE-2025-30906,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-30906 based on the given description, let's break down the components and their respective values according to the provided information:

1. **AV (Attack Vector)**: Given that this vulnerability allows 'Cross-site Scripting' and it affects a plugin which can be accessed via an application, we'll consider the Attack Vector as Adjacent.

2. **AC (Attack Complexity)**: The description suggests that this is a relatively common web page generation issue that would not require extensive knowledge or effort to exploit. Therefore, we'll categorize it as Low complexity.

3. **PR (Privileges Required)**: For 'Cross-site Scripting' vulnerabilities, the privilege required for exploitation can vary widely depending on the system and application configuration. However, in many cases of web-based Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities, no special privileges are needed to exploit them. Thus, we'll assign it as None.

4. **UI (User Interaction)**: Given that it's a 'Cross-site Scripting' vulnerability affecting reflected XSS (where user input is used without proper sanitization or encoding), user interaction would be Required to exploit the issue properly in most cases, especially if the plugin requires user input for data generation.

5. **S (Scope)**: The description doesn't specify that the impact of the vulnerability has changed from its initial state; it's more about exposing a potential that could lead to further exploitation under other conditions. Thus, we'll consider this as Unchanged.

6. **C (Confidentiality)**: Cross-site Scripting typically affects confidentiality by allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. Therefore, the scope of this vulnerability impacts Confidentiality.

7. **I (Integrity)**: While integrity could potentially be impacted in a broader sense due to potential data manipulation or modifications through injected scripts, it's less directly related than confidentiality. However, considering the specific impact on user experience and security posture, we'll categorize it as High because it can lead to unauthorized system changes over time.

8. **A (Availability)**: This type of vulnerability typically doesn't cause immediate system unavailability; however, a more sophisticated exploitation could potentially lead to system instability or performance degradation over time. The direct impact on availability is less straightforward than confidentiality and integrity but we'll consider it as High because prolonged exploitation could lead to system-level impacts.

Given these considerations:

- AV: Adjacent (A)
- AC: Low (L)
- PR: None (N)
- UI: Required (R)
- S: Unchanged (U)
- C: High (H)

CVE-2025-31010,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31010, we need to determine the values for each component based on the provided description.

Based on the CVE description, the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability indicates a potential attack vector against an application's web interface. Since this is not a physical or local access scenario but rather an adjacent one (as it involves manipulating web requests), we can conclude that the Attack Vector (AV) is Adjacent (A).

The nature of CSRF attacks generally falls under medium to high complexity, making the Attack Complexity (AC) High (H). This is because they require some amount of planning and knowledge about the application's request structure.

In terms of privileges required, an attacker typically needs administrative or elevated privileges to execute such attacks. Thus, the Privileges Required (PR) is High (H).

This attack exploits web applications' lack of proper handling for cross-site scripting requests, which necessitates user interaction in order to complete the exploit successfully. Therefore, User Interaction (UI) should be set as Required (R).

The scope impacted by this vulnerability seems unlikely to change based on how these types of attacks are commonly mitigated or because it often involves accessing user data without consent, making Scope (S) Changed (C).

Confidentiality risk is high since CSRF primarily targets sensitive information such as personal data. Hence, Confidentiality (C) should be set to High (H). 

Integrity attacks also carry a significant level of risk due to the manipulation nature of these attacks; thus, Integrity (I) should also be classified as High (H).

Lastly, an attacker exploiting this vulnerability may achieve a high level of availability disruption in their desired outcome because the application could potentially fail or redirect users away from what was intended by its improper handling, leading Availability (A) to be High (H) as well.

Based on these considerations, we can generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31010:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI=R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"
CVE-2025-31016,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31016, I will analyze the given information and assign values to each component based on common vulnerabilities of this nature.

The PHP Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability is an Adjacent (A) Attack Vector since it exploits adjacent files that are accessible due to a misconfigured PHP program. This is classified as Local (L), meaning the attack primarily affects local systems without external network access.

Considering the nature of the vulnerability, I will classify the Attack Complexity (AC) as High (H). The attacker needs relatively little skill to exploit this vulnerability and manipulate PHP scripts to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

Given that the vulnerability impacts the functionality of a web application and could potentially allow an attacker to write or modify files locally without external interaction, the Privileges Required (PR) is Low (L).

This issue involves user interaction as part of its exploitation process, so User Interaction (UI) is Required (R). Since the attack leverages local files and does not involve network interactions with remote servers, there's no need for Scope to be changed.

Given that this vulnerability could compromise data confidentiality, it should have a High (H) Confidentiality (C) impact. This vulnerability affects both personal identifiable information and other sensitive data stored on the system.

The Integrity (I) of data is also affected since an attacker could potentially modify or delete files without detection due to local access, which should be classified as High (H).

Finally, the Availability (A) of the system might also be impacted as critical resources such as web applications are affected. However, in most cases, this would not reach the highest level unless the vulnerability caused a complete failure of the application.

Based on these considerations, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31016 is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI|R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"

CVE-2025-31132,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31132, I need to analyze the vulnerability description provided. Based on the information:

- The vulnerability is accessible over a network (Network, N), which implies an Attack Vector of N.

- There are no specific privileges required for the attacker, so I will select 'None' (N) as the Privileges Required option.

- User interaction is required to execute code via this API endpoint, indicating that it requires user interaction. 

- The vulnerability's scope hasn't been altered by the exploit, which means the Scope is Unchanged (U).

- This vulnerability primarily impacts confidentiality since a logged-in user can potentially access or manipulate sensitive information without proper authorization.

- Integrity isn't mentioned as being impacted directly in the description, so I will select 'None' (N) for this option.

- Finally, there's no mention of any impact on availability from this specific exploit, meaning the Availability is unchanged (U).

*   AC: The attack complexity is 'H' as it involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities within the system configuration, which requires some skill and effort.

*   PR: No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability since an attacker only needs to send specific commands to the SMTP server. So, PR is 'N'.

*   UI: No user interaction is needed for exploitation because an attacker can send malicious data directly to the SMTP server. Therefore, UI is 'None (N)'.

*   S: The scope of this vulnerability has been changed with the introduction of the proxy protocol. Hence, S is 'C' or Changed.

*   C: The confidentiality impact of this vulnerability is high because an attacker can spoof its IP address and impersonate the reverse proxy server. So, C is 'H'.

*   I: The integrity of data is affected as an attacker can send malicious commands to the SMTP server and override any earlier ones. Therefore, I is 'H'.

*   A: There's a high availability impact because exploiting this vulnerability allows a client to make it appear as if the request came from a different IP address. So, A is 'H'."

CVE-2025-31141,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31141 based on the provided information, let's break down each component:

- AV (Attack Vector): Adjacent (A) - This is because the vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the issue without needing network access directly but with proximity to the affected system.
- AC (Attack Complexity): Medium - Although the description does not explicitly state attack complexity, it implies that there's a level of expertise needed due to handling exceptions and accessing certain configurations on the Cloud Profiles page. However, based on common CVSS ratings for similar vulnerabilities, we might lean towards High (H) as more attacks may exploit this.
- PR (Privileges Required): Medium - This is somewhat ambiguous but leaning towards High because it suggests there's a need for higher privileges to achieve the vulnerability exploitation, especially considering an exception could lead to critical information leakage.
- UI (User Interaction): Required (R) - This seems logical since any interaction on the Cloud Profiles page would likely involve user input or actions that could potentially exploit this vulnerability.
- S (Scope): Changed (C) - The cloud-based aspect and potential for sensitive data to be leaked indicate a significant scope, so we categorize it as changed.
- C (Confidentiality): High (H) - This is because the described issue directly impacts the confidentiality of user credentials stored in Cloud Profiles.
- I (Integrity): Medium (L) - While integrity might be impacted by any breach, this isn't explicitly stated but for most vulnerabilities, especially those concerning data leaks, integrity would generally be considered high. However, given our available information, we've chosen Low (L) to avoid over-assuming and maintain conservative estimates.
- A (Availability): High (H) - This is because the issue can potentially result in unavailability or significantly impacted access to necessary features until it's fixed.

Given these considerations, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31141 could be generated as follows:

AV: Adjacent (A) - The attack can be carried out from a different host or network, often referring to cross-site scripting attacks that don't require direct access to the target system.
AC: High (H) - This is due to the lack of input validation for user-provided data which increases the complexity of defending against such attacks.
PR: None (N) - There are no specific privileges required by the attackers beyond their ability to send HTTP requests to the affected site, indicating a non-invasive attack vector.
UI: Required (R) - An attacker needs some level of user interaction with the web application to execute their payload, which could be through submitting a malicious request or clicking on an element that triggers JavaScript execution.
S: Changed (C) - Since this is an XSS issue affecting data within the page itself, the scope is considered changed from the original intent of maintaining unchanged functionality.
C: High (H) - This vulnerability impacts both confidentiality by exposing user data to unauthorized parties, and integrity as it allows attackers to manipulate or inject malicious code into legitimate web pages.
I: High (H) - The impact on an organization's integrity increases due to the potential for widespread attacks against user sessions and personal data being exposed.
A: High (H) - This vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition where legitimate users are prevented from accessing their own content due to malicious scripts running in the context of the site.

CVE-2025-31526,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31526, we must break down each component as described above and match them with the appropriate values.

1. **AV (Attack Vector)**: Since this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands from a remote location, it matches the definition of an **Adjacent** attack vector. Therefore, AV is set to A.

2. **AC (Attack Complexity)**: This would be classified as High because the complexity arises from understanding how SQL Injection can be exploited and executing it effectively.

3. **PR (Privileges Required)**: The exploitation requires low privileges typically available to a normal user or admin for most web applications. Therefore, PR is set to Low.

4. **UI (User Interaction)**: Since this is an application bug that doesn't require any interaction with the user to exploit it and its result isn't something that would affect user experience directly without their knowledge (for example, changing a password), UI is set to None.

5. **S (Scope)**: This vulnerability's impact does not change based on how the system is used or configured beyond basic usage, so S is Unchanged.

6. **C (Confidentiality)**: Since this involves SQL Injection which affects sensitive data stored in the database and potentially could lead to unauthorized access of user information, it is set to High.

7. **I (Integrity)**: This vulnerability allows for arbitrary modification of data which directly impacts data integrity, making I also set to High.

8. **A (Availability)**: The presence of this vulnerability does not immediately affect availability because an attacker would have to exploit the SQL Injection in order to impact it significantly, but given that successful exploitation can lead to denial-of-service or other issues indirectly, A is set to Low due to its less direct nature compared to confidentiality and integrity.

CVE-2025-31558,"Based on the provided CVE description, I will extract the relevant information to generate the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector. Since there is no detailed description of vulnerabilities that would provide direct clues about AV, AC, PR, UI, S, C, I and A, a guess based on the given vulnerability type can be made.

Given the nature of the vulnerability (insertion of sensitive data), it's likely to have an 'A' (Adjacent) Attack Vector. The fact that it allows retrieval of sensitive data without any user interaction might imply a UI of 'None'.

Also, considering the potential impact and the sensitivity of the data involved, confidentiality (C) and integrity (I) scores are likely to be 'High'. Availability (A) could also potentially be impacted if this is a widespread vulnerability; thus, it might be 'Medium' but due to lack of information, I will default to High.

1. **AV (Attack Vector):** The attack vector describes how easily an attacker can exploit a vulnerability to launch a successful attack.
   - Given: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in flomei Simple-Audioplayer allows Stored XSS. This indicates that the vulnerability is **Stored**, meaning the vulnerability exists on the victim's own system, but an attacker doesn't need to exploit a network service (N). Therefore, it matches with **Adjacent (A)**.

2. **AC (Attack Complexity):** The attack complexity refers to how difficult or straightforward an attack is.
   - Given: The description does not specify the difficulty level of attacking this vulnerability directly; however, given that it's about stored cross-site scripting and involves input manipulation on a web application, it would likely fall into a category requiring low attack complexity due to the manual nature of exploiting such vulnerabilities.

3. **PR (Privileges Required):** This indicates the level of privilege required for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability.
   - Given: Stored XSS typically requires only user-level privileges to execute on behalf of the user or to manipulate the webpage in a way that affects other users' sessions, making it **None (N)**.

4. **UI (User Interaction):** This specifies whether user interaction is necessary for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability.
   - Given: For a stored XSS, an attacker doesn't necessarily need user interaction; they can execute the script on their own behalf once stored, so it's **None (N)**.

5. **S (Scope):** The scope refers to whether the attack affects data that is unchanged or changed after exploitation.
   - Given: Since this vulnerability involves a cross-site scripting issue affecting web pages and potentially user sessions, the scope of the attack does not change the state but could significantly impact confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Thus, it matches with **Changed (C)**.

6. **C (Confidentiality):** This component assesses the level of risk an attacker poses to the confidentiality of data.
   - Given: Stored XSS can allow unauthorized access to user session information, including personal details, which directly impacts data confidentiality, making this **High (H)**.

7. **I (Integrity):** The integrity component measures the risk to the security and data integrity of systems or applications.
   - Given: Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities like this one can lead to unauthorized modifications of user sessions, potentially affecting not just confidentiality but also data integrity directly, making it **High (H)**.

8. **A (Availability):** This assesses the risk of an attack on the availability of a service or system.
   - Given: Stored XSS attacks can cause a service like Simple-Audioplayer to become unreliable in its functionality for users due to potential manipulation by attackers, directly impacting availability, making it **High (H)**.

CVE-2025-31739,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31739, I'll break down the components based on the provided information.

Given information:
- The vulnerability is described as Missing Authorization.
- It allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.
- This issue affects Minimalistic Event Manager: from n/a through 1.1.1.

Assessing the CVSS Components:

- AV: Attack Vector
  - As this issue involves unauthorized access due to missing authorization, it falls under Network (N) as attackers could be on a different network or remotely exploit it.

- AC: Attack Complexity
  - The complexity here is High (H) because a simple incorrectly configured access control security level can allow exploitation without much effort by an attacker.

- PR: Privileges Required
  - Since the issue involves unauthorized access due to missing authorization, the privileges required are Low (L), as exploiting this vulnerability does not necessarily require elevated permissions.

- UI: User Interaction
  - Given that an attacker only needs a single instance of incorrectly configured access control security levels and exploiting it doesn't necessarily need user interaction beyond identifying such configurations, we mark it as None (N).

- S: Scope
  - This is Changed (C) because the exploit allows for unauthorized access to resources without needing to be present within the scope of the affected system.

- C: Confidentiality
  - This vulnerability affects Unauthorized Access and data being exposed, which falls under High (H) confidentiality.

- I: Integrity
  - This vulnerability also falls under High (H) integrity because even if no actual data is stolen, the integrity of the system and its configurations can be compromised.

Given:
- AV: Attack Vector
- AC: Attack Complexity
- PR: Privileges Required
- UI: User Interaction
- S: Scope
- C: Confidentiality
- I: Integrity
- A: Availability

Based on the description provided for CVE-2025-31814, which mentions a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in OwnerRez:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** Adjacent (A)
   - CSRF attacks typically require the attacker and the victim to be on the same network or device, making this attack vector most applicable.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H)
   - Creating a successful Cross-Site Request Forgery involves manipulating the user into performing unintended actions without their knowledge or consent, indicating high complexity due to the potential for sophisticated phishing attacks or malicious links.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)
   - CSRF exploits do not require elevated privileges since they operate on user input rather than system resources directly.

4. **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R)
   - This is because Cross-Site Request Forgery requires the victim to interact with the malicious request, which cannot be executed without user input or interaction.

5. **Scope (S):** Changed (C)
   - CSRF can change the scope by affecting users across domains and not confined to a specific system or network, making this more applicable than unchanged scope.

6. **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)
   - Since CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions being taken on behalf of an authenticated user, it directly impacts confidentiality.

7. **Integrity (I):** None (N)
   - CSRF attacks are primarily about changing the victim's state without their consent or knowledge, not modifying data in a way that would affect integrity.

8. **Availability (A):** High (H)
   - Although CSRF itself doesn't directly affect availability, if it leads to actions being taken by users that compromise system resources or lead to service unavailability, it can impact overall availability.

CVE-2025-31880,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we can analyze the provided information as follows:

- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue, which implies that an attacker could perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user without their knowledge or consent.
- It's classified as having a moderate level of attack complexity since it involves a user interaction and requires an adversary to be able to trick the victim into performing some action with malicious intent.
- The privileges required are low because the vulnerability doesn't seem to need any specific elevated access for exploitation. An attacker could use phishing attacks, among other methods, that don't require administrative or root privileges.
- The vector does not explicitly mention user interaction as a requirement due to its nature of being a request forgery that doesn’t necessarily involve direct user actions but could be executed with the help of user input via JavaScript. Nonetheless, for simplicity and following CVSS guidelines where possible, we might categorize it under required interactions given its CSRF context.
- The scope is not changed because while this vulnerability impacts an API that can potentially be used by a wide range of applications, there's no explicit indication in the provided information about data modification that crosses application boundaries in terms of scope.
- Confidentiality would be high since the issue involves unauthorized actions on behalf of a user, possibly impacting sensitive user data.
- Integrity is also impacted as it could result in modifications to system data or data stored on servers which are not expected to change without authorization.
- Availability is changed because this issue could lead to unexpected system behavior. If successful, an attacker could cause unintended and potential disruptive actions.

Therefore, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31880 is:
CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/I:H/A:C"
CVE-2025-31881,"Based on the provided CVE description, I'm unable to directly extract and generate the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31881 as I don't have access to real-time information about the specific vulnerability.

However, I can suggest some general steps that would typically be involved in generating a CVSS vector for such a vulnerability:

1. Determine the Attack Vector (AV): Based on the description of the vulnerability being ""Missing Authorization"" and potentially affecting an ""Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels,"" we could infer that it is an Adjacent (A) attack, as this would be the case when an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by simply accessing a network with the correct credentials.

2. Determine the Attack Complexity (AC): The complexity of the attack seems to be ""High"" since missing authorization allows exploitation without needing additional permissions or actions.

3. Determine the Privileges Required (PR): As the vulnerability is related to missing authorization, an attacker can exploit it even if they don't have elevated privileges.

4. Determine User Interaction (UI): Given that the vulnerability involves accessing a network with correct credentials and exploiting it, we could assume this requires some level of user interaction.

5. Determine Scope (S): This seems to be ""Changed"" because the vulnerability affects access control security levels in style mix pearl which means there's at least some configuration involved.

6. Determine Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) Impact: Since this is an authorization-related issue, the confidentiality impact would likely be High (H). The integrity aspect could also be affected as data not properly secured could result in unauthorized changes or exposure. However, without explicit information about what exactly is being exposed or changed due to incorrect access control levels, the availability aspect might be considered as ""None"" or low.

Given these steps and assuming an Adjacent attack vector with no need for additional privileges (other than a basic level), high complexity, user interaction required, scope change, and significant confidentiality but potentially minimal integrity or availability impact:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-31882,"Based on the CVE description, I would generate the following CVSS 3.1 vector:

CVE-2025-31885,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31885, I need to analyze the provided CVE description and match it with the corresponding CVSS 3.1 categories.

Based on the given CVE description, ""Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Daniel Floeter Hyperlink Group Block allows DOM-Based XSS,"" we can infer the following:

- AV: Network (N) - The vulnerability is a network-based issue as it involves web page generation and potential cross-site scripting attacks.
- AC: High (H) - The attack complexity seems to be high due to the improper neutralization of input, which suggests that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into the webpage.
- PR: None (N) - This vulnerability does not require any specific privileges or access rights to be exploited.
- UI: Required (R) - User interaction is necessary for an attacker to inject malicious scripts and take advantage of this vulnerability.
- S: Changed (C) - The scope has changed due to the vulnerability, as an attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into web pages affected by this issue.
- C: High (H) - This vulnerability affects confidentiality, as it allows attackers to execute scripts on a user's browser without their consent.
- I: High (H) - The integrity of the system is also compromised due to this cross-site scripting vulnerability, which can lead to unauthorized script execution.
- A: None (N) - There seems to be no availability compromise as the primary impact of this issue lies in confidentiality and integrity rather than making a system unavailable.

Putting all these together, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31885 is:

CVSS:3.1/N/H/None/R/C:H/I:H/N"
CVE-2025-31886,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31886, we need to extract information from the description and match it with the corresponding CVSS 3.1 categories.

From the CVE description, we can infer that:

- AV: Network (N), as this is an attack over a network.
- AC: High (H), because missing authorization makes configuration a high complexity vulnerability.
- PR: None (N), since no privileges are required to exploit the issue, but it does not necessarily mean they aren't needed in some context.
- UI: None (N), as there's no user interaction required for this vulnerability, though it could be exploited without direct user action.
- S: Changed (C), because the issue affects different security levels of the system.
- C: High (H), due to the missing authorization allowing unauthorized access or modification.
- I: High (H), since there is an integrity risk involved with the exploit being able to manipulate data or content.
- A: High (H), as the vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service and affects availability.

Therefore, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31886 is:

CVSS:3.1/N/H/N/N/C:H/I:H/A:H"

CVE-2025-31888,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, I'll need to break down the information into its respective components based on the CVSS 3.1 standard.

Given CVE-2025-31888 and its description as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WPExperts.io WP Multistore Locator, we can deduce the following:

- **AV:** The Attack Vector is ""Network (N)"" since it involves an attack that requires network access.
- **AC:** Since this vulnerability likely involves manipulation of user input and possibly exploiting specific configurations or settings within the software, we'll assume a higher complexity level. Therefore, the Attack Complexity is set to ""High (H)"".
- **PR:** Given that CSRF vulnerabilities often require minimal privileges to execute successfully, we categorize this as ""Low (L)"" since only low privileges are required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability effectively.
- **UI:** This is a User Interaction vulnerability. Since the vulnerability is not dependent on user action but rather on manipulating a request made by another party, we consider it as ""None (N)"".
- **S:** The Scope of the vulnerability remains unchanged (""Unchanged (U)"") since CSRF attacks are typically targeted at specific resources within the application without affecting its overall operation or functionality.
- **C:** This is related to Confidentiality. Given that a successful exploit involves manipulating requests which may include sensitive data but doesn't necessarily expose this data externally, we categorize it as ""High (H)"" since the confidentiality impact can be high if the manipulated request contains sensitive information.
- **I:** Considering the impact on data integrity (""None (N)"") because a CSRF vulnerability primarily affects the authenticity of the requests rather than the data's content or its validity before the request is made, we keep this as ""None (N)"".
- **A:** This involves Availability. Since the primary goal of a successful CSRF attack is to change the state of the system without affecting its operational functionality, we categorize it as ""High (H)"".

Now, let's format these components into the CVSS 3.1 vector:

CVE Description: The Docker image from acme.sh before 40b6db6 is based on a .github/workflows/dockerhub.yml file that lacks ""persist-credentials: false"" for actions/checkout.

From the description, we can infer that:

- AV (Attack Vector): Adjacent (A), since an attacker must have access to the same system as the Docker image.
- AC (Attack Complexity): High (H), because an attacker only needs to run a single action to gain access to credentials.
- PR (Privileges Required): Low (L) or none, as an attacker might not need elevated privileges. However, it's more likely that ""None"" is correct since no specific information about the privilege level of the attack vector was provided.
- UI (User Interaction): None (N), because there is no user interaction required for this vulnerability; the Docker image can be exploited without human intervention.
- S (Scope): Changed (C) is not applicable here as there's no mention of scope changing, so it defaults to ""Unchanged"" but in the context of the vector, it will remain ""U"".
- C (Confidentiality): High (H), since an attacker may have access to sensitive information stored on or transmitted by the Docker image.
- I (Integrity): High (H) as well because an attacker could potentially modify the Docker image without being detected initially.
- A (Availability): Not applicable as this is a confidentiality and integrity issue.

CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/I:N/A:N

Here's a brief explanation for each component:

- AV: Physical [P] - The attacker needs physical access to exploit this vulnerability.

- AC: Low [L] - This is due to the lack of sophisticated techniques and tools needed to perform an attack, making it easier for attackers to launch successful attacks without requiring extensive setup or special tools.

- PR: High [H] - High privileges are required because the attacker needs administrative access to exploit this vulnerability fully.

- UI: None Required [N] - This is because the PHP program will include local files without user interaction by default, as long as it follows its path resolution mechanism properly. User interaction isn't needed for successful exploitation if an attacker can simply trick the system into loading the malicious file using this method.

- S: Changed [C] - This vulnerability allows attackers to read arbitrary data on the same host (the server running BuddyForms).

- C: High [H] - The confidentiality of user sensitive information stored locally is impacted by this vulnerability. If an attacker can exploit this, they could potentially gain access to highly confidential local files.

- I: High [H] - Similar to confidentiality, integrity of data on the server is compromised with high risk if exploited, resulting in potential alteration or deletion of important system files and data.

- A: None [N] - The availability of the application isn't impacted directly by this vulnerability. However, if a remote attacker can exploit this, they could cause the BuddyForms application to crash or fail to function, ultimately causing service disruption."

Given the description of the PHP Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in Catch Themes' Catch Dark Mode, we can conclude that:

- The attack vector is Adjacent (A) since it allows remote code execution without requiring user interaction.
- The attack complexity is High (H) because exploiting this vulnerability requires knowledge of specific directory paths on a targeted server.
- Privileges Required is Local (L), indicating the attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to exploit this flaw.
- User Interaction is None (N), as it doesn't require any user action but can be triggered by an automated process or through exploitation of misconfigured permissions.
- Scope is Changed (C) because the vulnerability allows accessing a different part of the system's file structure without explicit request from the user.
- Confidentiality Impact is High (H) because this flaw could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Integrity Impact is Low (L), indicating that while an attacker might be able to perform malicious operations, their impact on the integrity of the system is minimized due to the nature of the file inclusion vulnerability.

CVE-2025-32262,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, let's break down its components based on the provided description:

- **AV (Attack Vector):** Since this vulnerability is remotely exploitable through a cross-site request forgery attack that likely requires user interaction with a malicious link or resource, it can be classified as **Adjacency (A)**. This indicates that an attacker doesn't need to physically access the targeted system but rather can trick a user into performing the action.

- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Without detailed information about how complex the exploitation process is, we might lean towards considering it as **High (H)** because cross-site request forgery attacks often require some level of complexity in crafting or delivering the malicious request. However, without specific details on the steps required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability, this classification could be more conservative.

- **PR (Privileges Required):** Given that a typical CSRF attack involves tricking users into performing actions they wouldn't normally do without being prompted, and assuming no elevated privileges are necessary for its execution (beyond what's standard for web interactions), we can classify it as **None (N)**. However, since this is an application vulnerability and not the OS itself, the classification might lean towards ""Low"" if considering the typical exploitation environment where such vulnerabilities occur.

- **UI (User Interaction):** This is clearly **Required (R)** because for a CSRF attack to be effective, the user must interact with the malicious request in some way. This interaction can vary widely from clicking on a link to submitting a form, depending on how the vulnerability is exploited.

- **S (Scope):** The impact of this vulnerability would generally remain within the scope of the application it affects, which means it's **Unchanged (U)** because the exploitation wouldn't expand beyond the targeted system or resource without user interaction that expands its scope.

- **C (Confidentiality):** Since this is a CSRF vulnerability affecting web applications, and assuming typical vulnerabilities of this nature don't result in sensitive data leakage directly due to the attack's mechanism, we might lean towards **Low (L)**. However, specific details about how sensitive data handling works within this application could influence this classification.

- **I (Integrity):** This also leans towards **Low (L)** for similar reasons as confidentiality. CSRF attacks typically don't lead to direct modification of critical system resources without involving user interaction that would otherwise change the scope.

- **A (Availability):** Given the nature of a CSRF attack, which is designed to cause the application or service to perform an unintended action under the guise of a legitimate request from a trusted source, this could impact the availability of the targeted service. Therefore, it's reasonable to classify it as **High (H)** because such attacks can lead to services being unavailable due to the malicious actions they initiate.

Based on these considerations, here is the generated CVSS 3.1 vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H"
CVE-2025-32263,"Based on the given CVE description, I will generate the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector as follows:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L"
CVE-2025-32264,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE-2025-32264, we can break down the description and apply it to the relevant components of the CVSS 3.1 scoring system.

1. **AV (Attack Vector)**: Network (N) - This is because the vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit a request being sent over the network.
2. **AC (Attack Complexity)**: High (H) - CSRF vulnerabilities typically require a certain level of sophistication from the attacker, involving understanding of web application functionalities and possibly manipulating user sessions.
3. **PR (Privileges Required)**: None (N) - The attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability; it can be done with basic user rights.
4. **UI (User Interaction)**: Required (R) - To successfully exploit a CSRF vulnerability, the victim's browser must make an HTTP request on behalf of the victim to a web application.
5. **S (Scope)**: Unchanged (U) - The scope of this issue does not change with the exploitation; it's more about whether sensitive data is being manipulated by the attack, which isn't explicitly mentioned but implies that no new information is exposed that wasn't already accessible without exploiting this vulnerability.
6. **C (Confidentiality)**: High (H) - CSRF vulnerabilities can be used to perform actions that alter or delete data, affecting high levels of confidentiality, especially when dealing with sensitive user information.
7. **I (Integrity)**: High (H) - By manipulating data through a CSRF attack, an attacker could potentially change the integrity of data within the system.
8. **A (Availability)**: High (H) - While not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description, high availability is often associated with systems that are targeted by CSRF attacks since such exploits can cause significant downtime or disrupt normal operations.
