- AV: Attack Vector - The vulnerability is 'Network' as it can be exploited remotely without requiring user interaction or physical access.
- AC: Attack Complexity - Given that this is a web application issue and the specific method of exploitation isn't detailed, but considering the severity mentioned (improper neutralization), I'll assume 'High'.
- PR: Privileges Required - This vulnerability doesn't seem to require elevated privileges as it's described as a cross-site scripting issue affecting user interaction.
- UI: User Interaction - The issue involves a reflected XSS attack, implying that user interaction is required for the exploitation process to succeed.
- S: Scope - Since this affects the entire web application (Omnify) and can lead to security breaches on users' devices when they access affected pages, it's considered 'Unchanged'.
- C: Confidentiality - As it involves data privacy through cross-site scripting attacks affecting user sessions, I'll categorize it as 'Low', though the severity of the impact could be higher due to the nature of the attack. However, considering the standard categories for confidentiality in CVSS scoring, I will stick with 'Low'.
- I: Integrity - This is also a concern as cross-site scripting can affect how data is processed and potentially lead to unauthorized changes or additions.
- A: Availability - The vulnerability's impact on availability isn't directly described, but the potential severity suggests it could significantly disrupt service in terms of user interaction and functionality.

CVE-2025-28906,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE description, we need to determine the values for each component based on the given information.

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** Given that this issue allows Stored XSS and is a web application vulnerability, it's likely to be an Adjacent or Network attack. However, since it specifically involves web pages and user input, we should consider it as Network.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** This is High because of the complexity involved in managing user inputs for security.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):** Since this is a Stored XSS vulnerability affecting web applications, no privileges are required.

4. **User Interaction (UI):** The issue doesn't require any user interaction; it's purely automated.

5. **Scope (S):** This is Changed because the attack involves manipulating data in the application itself.

6. **Confidentiality (C):** It affects confidentiality since the vulnerability allows for malicious scripts to be injected into web pages.

7. **Integrity (I):** The integrity of the application could also be affected as malicious changes are made, but it's not explicitly stated that data is being modified in a way that alters its integrity value (i.e., High).

8. **Availability (A):** There isn't an explicit mention of how this affects availability; however, considering the nature of the vulnerability and potential impact on performance or functionality under attack, we might lean towards Availability as it's somewhat related to system reliability.

CVE-2025-28909,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-28909, we need to analyze the provided description and map it to the appropriate CVSS 3.1 scoring options.

Given the information:

- **AV:** The attack vector is Adjacent (A) because Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) can be launched through adjacent resources.
- **AC:** The attack complexity is High (H) due to the potential difficulty in identifying and mitigating CSRF vulnerabilities.
- **PR:** Privileges required are None (N) since no special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **UI:** User interaction is Required (R) as users typically interact with web pages that can be vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **S:** The scope is Unchanged (U) because the issue doesn't affect any data outside of what's stored in or processed by the affected application, assuming standard web application practices are followed.
- **C:** Confidentiality isn't directly impacted since this is a web application security vulnerability but isn't specifically about sensitive data confidentiality. However, the vector is set to Low (L) as it could potentially allow an attacker to access data indirectly related to user information or functionality.
- **I:** Integrity isn't directly impacted in terms of data confidentiality or secrecy. The issue primarily affects the functionality and trust in web applications rather than altering system integrity or security in that traditional sense, so it's set to Low (L) as well.
- **A:** Availability is High (H) since a successful exploit could lead to the application becoming unavailable for users who rely on its functionality.

The given CVE is:
- CVE ID: CVE-2025-28913
- CVE Description: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Aftab Ali Muni WP Add Active Class To Menu Item allows Cross Site Request Forgery. This issue affects WP Add Active Class To Menu Item: from n/a through 1.0.

Based on the description, we can deduce the following information:

- The attack vector is ""Network (N)"" because it's a web application vulnerability.
- The attack complexity is likely to be ""High (H)"" due to the nature of CSRF being difficult to prevent, and this would have been harder to exploit if an authentication mechanism was in place.
- Since there are no specific privileges required mentioned for this issue, we can categorize this as ""None (N) Privileges Required.""
- The user interaction is ""Required (R)"" because a successful attack on the application requires the attacker to get valid session tokens, which typically require some form of user engagement or interaction.
- The scope of this vulnerability would be ""Changed (C)"" since it impacts how data can be manipulated and accessed from different parts of the system by exploiting the CSRF vector.
- Confidentiality (""High (H)"") is affected because the exploitation allows for access to data that wouldn't have been accessible otherwise, thus compromising confidentiality. However, given this issue's nature, let's categorize it as ""None (N)"" since the attack primarily targets modification rather than accessing sensitive data.
- Integrity (""Low (L)"") could also be argued as impacted, but given that CSRF typically doesn’t result in data destruction or creation in a controlled manner like other vulnerabilities might, we will stick with ""None (N) Integrity"".
- Availability is clearly affected by this vulnerability because the success of an attack implies the attacker is not getting their intended output due to external restriction such as rate limiting, IP blocking etc. Therefore, let's categorize it as ""High (H)"".

Here is the CVSS vector for the given CVE:

CVE-2025-28917,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to extract the required information from the description and match it with the corresponding CVSS 3.1 categories.

Based on the provided CVE ID and its description, I'll break down the necessary components:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: Since the vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker, without requiring a network connection, the Attack Vector is Adjacent.
  
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The description mentions that ""Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"" allows for Stored XSS. This indicates a medium complexity attack.

- **Privileges Required (PR)**: Since there are no specific privileges mentioned in relation to launching this vulnerability, we can classify it as None.

- **User Interaction (UI)**: As the manipulation is performed by an attacker on the server, user interaction is not required for the exploitation of this vulnerability, so the User Interaction category is None.

- **Scope (S)**: The attack impacts Custom Smilies from version n/a through 2.9.2, which means it changes or modifies something on the system without needing to access different data, thus S is Unchanged.

- **Confidentiality (C)**: There's no mention of sensitive information being leaked in the vulnerability description, so Confidentiality remains None.

- **Integrity (I)**: This vulnerability affects Stored XSS which impacts the integrity of the server by allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. Hence, Integrity is High.

- **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability primarily affects the Custom Smilies feature but does not imply a denial-of-service attack or impact on availability directly based on the description provided. Therefore, Availability remains None.

Using these identified values, we can construct the CVSS vector as follows:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:M/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"
CVE-2025-28918,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the provided CVE, we need to identify the corresponding CVSS score components based on the provided description.

For a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts through user input and the input is not properly neutralized by the application:

- Attack Vector (AV): Network (N), as this is typically how XSS attacks are launched.
- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H), because while the vulnerability involves client-side execution of malicious code, it's not about the difficulty of exploiting, but rather that an attacker could exploit it.

Given the scenario does not specify if any specific privileges were required to be escalated or exploited, we'll assign Privileges Required as None (N).

- User Interaction (UI): None (N), since XSS attacks typically do not require user interaction for execution; they can run automatically in the background without needing user intervention.

- Scope (S) of the vulnerability is Changed (C), because it affects how data is stored and processed within the application.

- Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are all Non-confidential (N). XSS attacks primarily target the confidentiality and integrity of user data, but since this example does not mention any specific confidentiality concerns or if there is a particular risk to availability, and given that the vulnerability doesn't directly imply significant integrity risks in how the server handles data storage in general, we assign them as Non-confidential (N).

CVE-2025-29766,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze it and match its characteristics with the corresponding CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) categories.

Based on the provided information, the description states that Tuleap has missing CSRF protections on artifact submission & edition from the tracker view. This indicates an attack vector where an attacker could trick victims into performing certain actions (Submission or editing artifacts), which implies a remote attack vector, as the vulnerability is in a web application and the attack might be launched remotely without requiring human interaction.

The CVSS categories can be analyzed as follows:
- **AV:** Attack Vector: Remote ([N])
- **AC:** Attack Complexity: Medium to High due to the nature of CSRF attacks which often exploit user input but may require some manipulation or insight, making it harder than a Low complexity attack (High [H] seems more appropriate)
- **PR:** Privileges Required: None ([N]) as the attacker only needs to trick victims without requiring any elevated privileges.
- **UI:** User Interaction: Required ([R]) because the vulnerability relies on user interaction to be triggered.
- **S:** Scope: Changed ([C]) due to the remote nature of the attack which can affect multiple systems (or at least all users of the affected web application).
- **C:** Confidentiality: Low ([L]) as the vulnerability does not directly compromise data confidentiality; it is more about manipulating user actions.
- **I:** Integrity: High ([H]) because the vulnerability compromises the integrity of the system by allowing an attacker to trick victims into performing actions that could alter or delete important information without direct access to sensitive areas.
- **A:** Availability: Low ([L]) as this primarily affects a web application’s availability for users, with the critical factor being whether they can access the functionality they need.

Therefore, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-29766 based on the provided description and analysis would be:

   - AC: Attack Complexity
   - PR: Privileges Required
   - UI: User Interaction
   - S: Scope
   - C: Confidentiality
   - I: Integrity
   - A: Availability

2. Determine each component value based on the CVE description.

Based on the provided CVE ID and description, the vector components can be determined as follows:
- AV: Network (N) is chosen because the vulnerability can be launched remotely.
- AC: High (H) is chosen because a malicious user can exploit this issue with minimal effort. This can result in Denial of Service if the filesystem runs out of space.
- PR: None (N) is chosen because no special privileges are required to exploit this issue.
- UI: None (N) is chosen because the attack does not require any interaction from a human user.
- S: Changed (C) is chosen because the affected component has been modified by an attacker's manipulation of the input stream.
- C: High (H) is chosen because the confidentiality of the system may be compromised if vLLM crashes.
- I: Low (L) is chosen because the integrity of the filesystem might be compromised but only in terms of available space. The data stored on disk remains unchanged.
- A: None (N) is chosen because vLLM will likely continue to operate even if it encounters this vulnerability.

Based on these determinations, the CVSS vector for CVE ID `CVE-2025-29770` can be generated as follows:

CVE-2025-29783,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE, let's break down its components according to the CVSS 3.1 standard:

- Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - The vulnerability is remotely accessible without requiring the attacker to be within the network.

- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) - The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability is high due to the involvement of unsafe deserialization in Mooncake, which makes it difficult to exploit.

- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - The attack does not require any privileges to execute successfully; it can run with the privileges of the distributed host's process.

- User Interaction (UI): None (N) - This is a remote code execution vulnerability where no user interaction is required for the attacker to exploit it.

- Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability does not change the scope in any way; however, its impact on the system might be significant due to the potential for remote code execution.

- Confidentiality (C): High (H) - This vulnerability impacts confidentiality since it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a distributed host, potentially accessing or modifying data without authorization.

- Integrity (I): High (H) - The integrity of the system is also impacted because executing arbitrary commands on a host can lead to unauthorized changes being made to its state, including its data and configuration.

- Availability (A): Low (L) - While the presence of this vulnerability could initially appear as if it impacts availability since an attacker can execute commands without needing network access, the key impact here is on confidentiality and integrity rather than making the system less available to authorized users. The primary concern is how this affects data security and system trustworthiness.

Based on these considerations, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-29783 would be:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"

- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent or Local is not mentioned. However, it does mention manipulation of a cart after initiating PayPal Express Checkout process, which implies local interaction with a specific system.
- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) due to allowing customers to pay less than the actual total order value and integrity of payment processing being compromised.
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) as it doesn't require elevated privileges to exploit.
- User Interaction (UI): Required (R) because users have to interact with their cart to manipulate the item quantity, triggering an action that exploits the vulnerability.
- Scope (S): Changed (C) since PayPal captures a modified amount instead of the updated total order value.
- Confidentiality (C): High (H) due to financial data being compromised and business owners facing potential losses.
- Integrity (I): High (H) because manipulating payment amounts compromises the integrity of the payment processing system.
- Availability (A): None (N) as the described scenario doesn't explicitly mention the impact on availability.

Therefore, the CVSS vector for the given CVE is:

CVE-2025-29795,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-29795, we need to analyze the provided CVE description and fill in the corresponding vector components based on the given information.

Since no detailed description of the vulnerability is provided, I will rely on general assumptions about common vulnerabilities that could be discovered by CVE-2025-29795. This includes information like ""Privilege Escalation"" or ""Unstable HTTP Handler,"" etc.

Assuming that this vulnerability involves:

1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Network, since it is a remote attack.
2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: High, as some vulnerabilities may be quite hard to exploit without the right tools.
3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: None, because attackers might be able to bypass certain security measures or reach into system resources with just minimal permissions.
4. **User Interaction (UI)**: None, since attackers could exploit the vulnerability remotely without requiring user interaction.
5. **Scope (S)**: Unchanged, as this may not cause a modification in the way data is accessed within the system scope itself; it could potentially allow users to bypass those checks but might still function similarly internally if the system has sufficient safeguards.
6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Low, because an attacker exploiting such a vulnerability might only be able to view information or take actions that wouldn't normally result in sensitive data being leaked or deleted.
7. **Integrity (I)**: High, since attackers could potentially alter critical system settings and perform actions that would change the integrity of data on these systems.
8. **Availability (A)**: Low, because if this vulnerability is exploited, it may cause system instability, leading to a decrease in overall availability.

With these assumptions, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-29795 can be generated as follows:

CVE-2025-29914,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE description, I will break down the provided information into its corresponding components:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** The vulnerability is remote and does not require human interaction to exploit. This suggests a Network Attack Vector.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Although the exact complexity isn't detailed in the description, considering that bypassing rules without deeper configuration or privilege escalation might generally fall under medium complexity due to the involvement of modsecurity compatibility, I will select High as it is more conservative and aligns with typical issues affecting web applications.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** The exploit bypasses rules without requiring any specific privileges beyond those normally needed for a web application firewall to operate. Thus, the ""None"" option seems most appropriate.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Since there is no interaction required by the attacker to trigger this vulnerability and it exploits configuration directly, I will select ""None"".

- **Scope (S):** This vulnerability affects the unchanged scope of the web application's request handling process. Therefore, I will choose ""Unchanged"".

- **Confidentiality (C):** Given that there isn't any indication this is a confidentiality violation (beyond normal web application firewall functionality), the default low level applies.

- **Integrity (I):** Similar to Confidentiality, as there's no explicit mention of data integrity violations beyond typical web app flaws, ""Low"" seems most suitable.

- **Availability (A):** Since this does not inherently affect system availability directly through exploits that prevent access to resources, the standard default for such issues is chosen.

Therefore, generating the CVSS 3.1 vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-29922,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE ID and description, we'll analyze each component:

- Attack Vector (AV): Given that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, we should select 'N' as the attack vector since it's a network-based attack.

- Attack Complexity (AC): The complexity of an exploit is determined by factors such as how difficult it is to execute and prepare. In this case, there is no information provided about how complex it might be to exploit this vulnerability, so we should select 'H' for high attack complexity.

- Privileges Required (PR): This refers to the privileges or access required by an attacker to exploit a vulnerability. Given that an attacker could create and delete objects in any arbitrary target workspace without any APIBinding, this is an example of high privilege requirements, hence selecting 'H'.

- User Interaction (UI): An attacker doesn't need user interaction to exploit this vulnerability because they can automatically trigger the creation or deletion of objects via the APIExport VirtualWorkspace.

- Scope (S): This refers to whether the impact of a vulnerability changes based on which system components are affected. In this case, since an attacker could create and delete objects in any arbitrary target workspace for pre-existing resources, without needing any specific permissions, it indicates that the scope has been changed, hence selecting 'C'.

- Confidentiality (C): Since there isn't information provided about how confidentiality is impacted by this vulnerability, we select 'N' as no impact on confidentiality.

- Integrity (I): The integrity of an object refers to its state or accuracy. This vulnerability allows for the creation and deletion of objects even when specific permissions are not met, hence indicating that the integrity of those objects has been compromised, thus selecting 'H'.

- Availability (A): An attacker could create and delete objects in any arbitrary target workspace without needing any APIBinding, so this indicates a lack of availability or impact on system availability, hence selecting 'N'.

CVE-2025-29923,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to identify the corresponding attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, scope, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Based on the description:

- The vulnerability allows an attacker to receive out-of-order responses or incorrect responses for multiple use cases.
- This is a network-related vulnerability because it involves data transmission over a network.
- There's no mention of local access or physical access required.
- It can be done without user interaction, as it is a server-side issue.

Given these characteristics:

- AV: Network (N)
- AC: High (H), due to the potential for out-of-order responses and incorrect data being sent back to the client. 
- PR: None (N) because no additional privileges are required beyond what is already available.
- UI: None (N)
- S: Changed (C), as the behavior of the program changes based on network conditions or the state of the connection.
- C: Confidentiality, since this issue deals with how data is transmitted between clients and servers. Therefore, it affects confidentiality.

Given these characteristics:

- I: Integrity, because an attacker could potentially use out-of-order responses to alter the client's expectations for command output and behavior.
- A: High (H), because if the server responds incorrectly or in order unexpectedly, that impacts availability directly by creating issues with how commands are executed on the client side.

AV: Network (N) - The vulnerability allows an attacker to leverage the fast-jwt library's design flaw to forge a JWT that can be accepted by a victim application.

AC: High (H) - Due to the permissive validation of the iss claim, an attacker could craft a complex JWT structure with multiple domains in the issuer array, leading to potential exploitation.

PR: None (N) - The vulnerability does not require any special privileges or permissions to exploit; it is designed to bypass existing security checks.

UI: Required (R) - An application relying on get-jwks and using fast-jwt must be involved for an attacker to leverage this vulnerability, indicating the need for user interaction.

S: Unchanged (U) - The intent of the issue with the iss validation does not change; it still allows a malicious actor to bypass intended security checks without changing the scope.

C: High (H) - The ability to forge valid JWTs based on an attacker's control over the issuer array leads to a significant risk of confidentiality breach, as the application accepts tokens from attackers who have crafted these.

I: Low (L) - Although an attacker could potentially use this flaw to create forged tokens that appear to come from legitimate issuers, it is still not immediately exploitable without user interaction.

A: High (H) - The fast-jwt library's design flaw results in a potential availability risk if not properly addressed; applications using this library must upgrade to 5.0.6 for protection against such attacks.

Given that the vulnerability allows an attacker to upload a crafted ZIP file causing the server to consume all available system memory, we can categorize this attack as ""Physical"" since it involves manipulating a physical medium (the ZIP file). This corresponds to AV: A.

The nature of consuming all available system memory indicates high complexity due to potential system resource exhaustion. This is categorized under AC:H, which denotes High Attack Complexity.

There are no specific privileges that need to be exploited in this vulnerability; the primary effect of the exploit is not on privilege escalation but rather on server performance and system resources. Thus, PR:N can be assigned for this case.

Since the attack does not require user interaction (the server consumes memory while the attacker uploads the ZIP file), UI: N is appropriate.

This vulnerability affects all systems that have the kin-openapi software installed, making it a universal scope issue. Therefore, S:C is correct here, indicating the scope remains unchanged.

The confidentiality and integrity of data are not directly impacted by the exploit since it primarily causes the server to consume system memory without necessarily manipulating or exposing sensitive data. Hence, C:N and I:N can be assigned for this case.

Finally, because the attack's primary effect is on the availability (the server being unable to function properly due to consuming all available resources), A: L is appropriate, indicating low availability impact.

CVE-2025-30155,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to break down the description into its respective components based on the CVSS 3.1 standard. Here's how we can do it:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** The description does not mention any remote exploitation of a vulnerability. However, since there is no information about local or physical access either, it defaults to `N` for Network.
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** There is no specific detail on the complexity required for this exploit, but given that there are detailed release notes indicating fixes, we can deduce that it's likely a medium complexity vulnerability. Therefore, it should default to `H`.
- **Privileges Required (PR):` Given that this is an Open Source application and considering the nature of its vulnerability, it could logically be considered low.
- **User Interaction (UI):` The description doesn't explicitly state that user interaction is required for exploitation, so we'll leave it as `N`, indicating no user interaction.
- **Scope (S):` Since this vulnerability impacts a read permission in the REST API without any indication of altering or modifying data, it should be considered `U`.
- **Confidentiality (C):` This vulnerability impacts permissions related to reading. Given that it's not directly about sensitive data but rather access control, we can safely consider it low.
- **Integrity (I):` The description doesn't imply any alteration of data that would impact system integrity; hence, it defaults to `N`.
- **Availability (A):` Since this vulnerability does not affect the availability of the service directly by causing denial-of-service scenarios but rather impacts how read permissions are enforced, we can infer it as `N`.

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, as it can be triggered by sending a local reply to an external server. Therefore, the Attack Vector is set to ""Network (N)"".
2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** This requires some knowledge of Envoy's ext_proc HTTP filter and its life time issue. Thus, the Attack Complexity is set to ""High (H)"".
3. **Privileges Required (PR):** The exploit does not require any privileges; it can be launched without needing elevated access. Therefore, Privileges Required is set to ""None (N)"".
4. **User Interaction (UI):** The exploitation occurs without user interaction because the described situation involves a failure of a websocket handshake triggered by Envoy's internal logic, which doesn't need human intervention to exploit the crash. Hence, User Interaction is set to ""None (N)"".
5. **Scope (S):** The attack targets an external server and has no unchanged configuration scope that can be exploited. Thus, Scope is set to ""Unchanged (U)"".
6. **Confidentiality (C):** As this vulnerability does not directly affect the confidentiality of the data being processed but involves a potential crash and denial-of-service scenario, Confidentiality remains unaffected in a practical sense for most environments. Therefore, it's set to ""None (N)"".
7. **Integrity (I):** The integrity might be affected depending on the specific data involved and how Envoy is configured; however, for the general context of this vulnerability description, Integrity isn't directly impacted due to the nature of the attack described as a denial-of-service scenario. Hence, it's set to ""None (N)"".
8. **Availability (A):** The primary effect of this exploit is a potential crash and denial-of-service that can be launched remotely against Envoy servers, thus affecting availability. Therefore, Availability is set to ""Low (L)"".

CVE-2025-30164,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to determine the values for each component:

- AV: Attack Vector
- AC: Attack Complexity
- PR: Privileges Required
- UI: User Interaction
- S: Scope
- C: Confidentiality
- I: Integrity
- A: Availability

Based on the provided information:

- The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect a user to any location.
- It's described as allowing an attacker to manipulate the backend and visit the location, implying it's not just about visiting but manipulating it.

Given these considerations:
- AV is Network because it affects users over a network (the web interface).
- AC is High because manipulating a system's backend would require sufficient understanding of its workings.
- PR is None because there's no information provided that an attacker needs special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- UI is Required because the user interaction allows the attacker to potentially manipulate the redirect location, implying user involvement in initiating actions rather than just viewing content.
- S is Changed because the redirect allows for any location to be chosen.
- C is None (Low) since there's no mention of data being accessed or leaked that would imply confidentiality was breached.
- I is Low (None) as there's no information suggesting any integrity issues, such as modification of data.
- A is High (None) because the attack may allow for redirecting to any location on the system, potentially affecting the user's experience directly.

Therefore, the CVSS 3.1 vector for this CVE would be:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-30168,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE ID and description, we need to analyze it according to the CVSS 3.1 guidelines.

First, let's break down the information given in the CVE description:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The vulnerability can be launched remotely.
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack complexity is not specified in detail within the given text. However, based on the description provided, we will assume it is High due to the potential use of stored credentials across multiple apps, indicating a high level of difficulty and potential impact.
  
Given that we can't find any specific information about AC in the provided description, let's assign 'H' for Attack Complexity.

- **Privileges Required (PR)**: The privileges required are not explicitly stated. Given that the exploitation may involve accessing user credentials across multiple apps and manipulating these stored credentials to authenticate, this attack seems more aligned with exploiting access controls than requiring specific, high-level privileges. Thus, we will assume 'N' for Privileges Required.

- **User Interaction (UI)**: The CVE does not require a user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. Therefore, we can assign 'N' to User Interaction.

- **Scope (S)**: This vulnerability seems to affect the scope of authentication across multiple apps by allowing credentials from one app to authenticate in another without requiring any changes on the client-side for access control. Since it involves storing and using credentials in a way that might change how user data is protected, this could be considered 'C'.

- **Confidentiality (C)**: This vulnerability affects the confidentiality of user authentication data across multiple apps. Given its potential impact on stored data integrity, we will assign 'H' for Confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, this vulnerability impacts the integrity of authentication data due to the possibility of using credentials from one app to authenticate in another without proper validation or access control measures in place. Therefore, it's reasonable to consider 'H'.

- **Availability (A)**: There is no direct indication that this vulnerability affects availability. However, since upgrading is recommended for fixing the issue, we might assume there could be potential for availability impacts if not fixed promptly and properly.

Given these considerations, here is the CVSS vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"

CVE-2025-30205,"Based on the CVE description provided, I would categorize it as:

AV: N (Network) - The vulnerability does not require physical access to the system and can be exploited over a network.

AC: H (High) - The attack complexity is high because the faulty function instrumentation in the optional kanidm patches provided by kandim-provision requires significant expertise to exploit.

PR: L (Low) - No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, as it only affects system log credentials that are not sensitive.

UI: R (None) - User interaction is not required, as the leaked admin credentials are stored in the system log and do not require user interaction to be exploited.

S: U (Changed) - The scope of the vulnerability has changed due to the introduction of the faulty function instrumentation in the kanidm patches.

C: N (None) - Confidentiality is not impacted, as the leaked admin credentials are not sensitive information.

I: L (Low) - Integrity is impacted lowly because although credentials are leaked, they are stored in a non-sensitive log, not affecting the integrity of the system data.

A: H (High) - Availability is impacted high due to the possibility of unauthorized access to administrative credentials which may impact normal operation of the affected application."
CVE-2025-30208,"Based on the provided CVE description, I would rate it as follows:

AV: P (Physical) - The vulnerability allows an attacker to access and return arbitrary files from the server, which is a physical attack.

AC: H (High) - The exploit bypasses a limitation that is not properly implemented in the regex pattern, requiring high skill and effort to apply.

PR: N (None) - The vulnerability does not require any specific privileges to be exploited.

UI: R (Required) - An interaction with the server is required for the attack to succeed.

S: C (Changed) - The scope of the impact changes depending on whether the application is exposed to the network or not.

C: H (High) - The vulnerability allows an attacker to access and return arbitrary files from the server, which could potentially be used to steal sensitive data.

I: N (None) - There is no indication that the vulnerability would affect any data other than the file contents being returned.

A: L (Low) - While the vulnerability does allow for arbitrary file returns, it's not necessarily a low availability attack, but rather an information disclosure one.

CVE-2025-30216,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we'll analyze each component based on the provided details and options:

- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent (A) is typically used for vulnerabilities that do not require network access or lateral movement. It seems like there's a risk of privilege escalation through this vulnerability but does not necessarily imply an attack vector that requires adjacent networks.

- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) is indicated by the complexity of the issue described, such as heap overflows requiring exploitation to execute arbitrary code or cause system instability.

- Privileges Required (PR): None (N), since a successful exploit likely wouldn't require an attacker to have elevated privileges from their initial access point but rather could be executed without needing to escalate.

- User Interaction (UI): None (N) because while an exploit might involve some interaction with the application, it seems that this vulnerability primarily involves executing malicious code without needing user input to execute it directly.

- Scope (S): Changed (C), as there's a risk of arbitrary code execution or system instability, indicating that the scope extends beyond just accessing data or controlling the system in an unchanged manner.

- Confidentiality (C): High (H) due to the potential for executing arbitrary code, which would compromise confidentiality by allowing unauthorized access and potentially read sensitive information.

- Integrity (I): High (H), as there's a risk of executing malicious code that could alter system integrity or data on the affected host.

- Availability (A): None (N) because while it's more about the system becoming unstable or unavailable due to successful exploitation, the direct impact might be seen in its availability for legitimate users.

CVE-2025-30219,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-30219 based on the provided description, I will analyze it as follows:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Adjacent (A) because an attacker can exploit this by accessing RabbitMQ directly without needing any additional privileges or having access to the network.
  
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H) due to the complexity involved in modifying virtual host name on disk, recovering it and making changes to arbitrary JavaScript code.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N), because this doesn't require administrative privilege but only an ability to interact with RabbitMQ.

- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) since this attack could potentially execute JavaScript without user interaction via other means such as exploiting RabbitMQ's file system functionality.

- **Scope (S):** Changed (C) as the attacker can modify virtual host name on disk and trigger arbitrary JavaScript code execution in management UI users' browsers.

- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H), because if successful, this could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into user’s browsers by executing it within management UI.

- **Integrity (I):** Low (L) since the modification is limited and doesn’t affect other data beyond the modified file or virtual host settings.

- **Availability (A):** High (H), because if this can be exploited, RabbitMQ could become less available for legitimate users.

Therefore, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-30219 would be:

CVE-2025-30234,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to determine each component based on the description provided. Here's how I would break it down:

- Attack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is not specified as being remote or local; thus, the default for a network-based vulnerability is assumed.
- Attack Complexity (AC): Since the attack involves using static host SSH keys, which are already set up by the system, and given there's no information about user interaction or complexity in exploiting this feature for unauthorized access, it suggests that AC = H (High).
- Privileges Required (PR): The static host SSH keys don't provide an environment where a normal user could exploit them without administrative privileges. Therefore, PR = N (None), as the attacker wouldn't need elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- User Interaction (UI): Since the attack doesn't require any user interaction and is more of a system-level vulnerability due to the pre-configured static host SSH keys, UI = N (None).
- Scope (S): The static host SSH keys being in an immutable image suggests that the scope is unchanged. Therefore, S = U (Unchanged).
- Confidentiality (C): Given that the vulnerability involves accessing and exploiting pre-configured static host SSH keys which typically contain sensitive information like user credentials, this would be considered High. Therefore, C = H (High).
- Integrity (I): This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of system data due to the use of static host SSH keys which are pre-set for security purposes but were not properly secured in the context of this issue. Hence, I = L (Low) because it's about a potential vulnerability rather than an outright breach.
- Availability (A): The availability could be impacted if the static host SSH key image is vulnerable and can lead to unauthorized access to critical services that are protected by the SSH keys. However, given the nature of the vulnerability itself not being related to preventing unauthorized access directly but more about a configuration oversight or the pre-configured static nature which might already mitigate such vulnerabilities, this remains at N (None) as the impact on availability isn't described.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** The complexity of this attack is considered High because it involves exploiting multiple vulnerabilities in order to bypass security measures. AC is set to H (High).

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Since there's no mention of needing elevated privileges, PR is set to N (None).

- **User Interaction (UI):** For this vulnerability, user interaction is required for the attack to be successful, so UI is set to R (Required).

- **Scope (S):** As this vulnerability affects only the OpenSlides application itself and does not impact other systems, S is set to C (Changed).

- **Confidentiality (C):** This vulnerability primarily affects the confidentiality of user session data. Thus, C is set to H (High).

- **Integrity (I):** The integrity of the system affected by this vulnerability remains intact, so I is set to N (None).

- **AC:** Attack Complexity: This issue does not require any special knowledge or privileges and allows for exploitation with minimal effort. Hence, AC:H.

- **PR:** Privileges Required: No specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability; an attacker must only have access to the local system with the ability to extract ZIP archives. Therefore, PR:N.

- **UI:** User Interaction: The attack is possible without user interaction since it involves exploiting the ZIP archive on the server side, given that the user can download and extract the files after the exploit has been applied. Hence, UI:N.

- **S:** Scope: Although the vulnerability could potentially result in the extraction of sensitive information, the actual impact depends upon the tools used for extraction, which might not be maliciously designed to seek out such data specifically. Therefore, S:C.

- **C:** Confidentiality: The vulnerability primarily affects local availability rather than confidentiality. Hence, C:L.

- **I:** Integrity: The potential effect on integrity is that an attacker could potentially overwrite files locally outside of the chosen directory if they can extract and uncompress the ZIP archive with a malicious tool. Therefore, I:L.

- **A:** Availability: An attacker does not necessarily need to manipulate anything to affect availability, as the zip file contains all local files in a particular folder which could be used for malicious purposes without further manipulation of system files or configuration. Hence, A:N.

- Privileges Required (PR): No privileges are required for the exploitation of this vulnerability, so PR is set to N (None).
- User Interaction (UI): The system responds differently based on the user's existence in the system but there isn't any direct interaction with a user to exploit. Hence, UI remains N (None).
- Scope (S): The vulnerability affects Confidentiality and Integrity as it involves password hashing issues which can lead to unauthorized access. Thus, S is set to C (Changed) for both.
- Confidentiality (C): Given the potential for passwords to be exposed or compromised due to hash omission, C is set to H (High).
- Integrity (I): This vulnerability directly impacts data integrity by allowing unauthorized access to password hashes. Therefore, I is also set to H (High).

- AC is High (H) due to the complex algorithm involving XML string copy and inline replacement of parts of a string with relocation of later data, indicating high complexity.
- PR is None (N) because there are no privileges required for this vulnerability.
- UI is None (N) as the exploit may be possible remotely but doesn't require user interaction in the traditional sense.
- S is Unchanged (U) since the vector doesn't indicate any scope change; it's about how much of an impact the vulnerability might have, which seems not to exceed the full system or application functionality.
- C is High (H) due to confidentiality being a concern here, as the bug involves the manipulation of strings with relocation of later data, indicating potential for sensitive information exposure.
- I is High (H) since the algorithm mentioned could be used for integrity violations if an attacker can manipulate the string in a way that relocates sensitive data.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Here's my explanation for each component:

- AV: Attack Vector [Network (N)]
The attack vector is Network because the sensitive data can be exposed through API calls, which are typically network-based.

- AC: Attack Complexity [High (H)]
Attack complexity is High because a successful exploit of this vulnerability would require some programming and understanding of Directus's Flow system. The fact that the issue only occurs in specific conditions makes it more challenging to exploit than a simple buffer overflow or other common types of vulnerabilities.

- PR: Privileges Required [None (N)]
This vulnerability does not require any privileges beyond what an attacker already has, such as access to the affected API endpoint. This means there is no additional authorization step needed to trigger the vulnerability.

- UI: User Interaction [None (N)]
There is no user interaction required for this attack. The vulnerability occurs due to a programming bug within Directus's API response generation, which can be exploited without any user involvement.

- S: Scope [Confidential (C)]
The scope of the affected data is Confidential because it includes sensitive information such as environmental variables, sensitive API keys, and user accountability information.

- C: Confidentiality [Low (L)]
While some of this data is highly confidential (such as full API keys), only a portion of the data leaked in this issue would be considered sensitive (e.g., operational data or specific account information). Thus, while not all data is highly confidential, exposure still poses a significant risk due to its nature.

- I: Integrity [Low (L)]
This vulnerability primarily affects confidentiality rather than integrity. The stolen data includes sensitive API keys and user accountability information, but these are not necessarily modified in any way during the attack.

- A: Availability [Low (L)]
The primary impact of this vulnerability is a potential availability risk due to data exposure, which could be used for unauthorized access or further malicious activities. However, Directus has already addressed this issue with version 11.5.0, reducing the impact on availability over time."

CVE ID: CVE-2025-30369
CVE Description: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. The API for deleting an organization custom profile field is supposed to be restricted to organization administrators, but its handler failed to check that the field belongs to the same organization as the user. Therefore, an administrator of any organization was incorrectly allowed to delete custom profile fields belonging to a different organization. This is fixed in Zulip Server 10.1.

Based on the description:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** The vulnerability is Remote, which corresponds to `Network (N)`.
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Given that an administrator of any organization was incorrectly allowed to delete custom profile fields belonging to a different organization with no additional information required for exploitation other than being in the system, it's reasonable to categorize this as High Complexity (`H`).
- **Privileges Required (PR):** Since only an admin could exploit this with minimal interaction and privileges were not explicitly mentioned as 'high' or otherwise, we can conclude `None (N)` is more accurate.
- **User Interaction (UI):** Although user interaction was involved, it wasn't ""required"", so the correct value for this component would be `None (N)`.
- **Scope (S):** Since an administrator from any organization could exploit the vulnerability without needing access to different areas of the system, and only their specific fields were affected, we consider the Scope as Unchanged (`U`).
- **Confidentiality (C):** The given information doesn't provide enough context about what exactly is being leaked; however, if assuming an attacker could steal all necessary data due to this security flaw, Confidentiality would be High (`H`).
- **Integrity (I):** Since the description implies that deleting fields from a different organization allowed exploitation without indicating that other system integrity was compromised or that the exploit altered the original data in any way, Integrity can also be considered as High (`H`) for this example.
- **Availability (A):** There is no information suggesting an availability compromise would occur due to exploiting this vulnerability, so Availability remains at `None (N)`.

- **Attack Vector (AV):** The attack is launched remotely as part of opening a specific Git repository in a terminal. Therefore, the Attack Vector is Adjacent (A).
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** The exploit doesn't explicitly state the complexity required for the attack. However, considering the attack vector and its potential impact on user permissions, we can categorize it as High (H).
- **Privileges Required (PR):** Given that the vulnerability allows a command injection without user permission, Privileges Required is None (N).
- **User Interaction (UI):** The interaction required for this exploit involves clicking a menu entry to open a terminal and run a specific command. Therefore, it requires User Interaction.
- **Scope (S):** Since a new directory name with the injection string may be created by an external user or process without direct interaction from the victim, the Scope is Unchanged (U).
- **Confidentiality (C):** The attack's primary impact is on the confidentiality of files and directories within the Git repository. However, since we are dealing with a command injection vulnerability in a non-sensitive area like the Git repository, Confidentiality is Low (L). 
- **Integrity (I):** Integrity is also affected because an external user can inject commands to alter or delete files. Thus, Integrity is High (H).
- **Availability (A):** Although availability isn't directly mentioned in the description, considering that a command injection could potentially cause issues with system processes or slow down performance, we might categorize it as Low (L) based on the general impact of this vulnerability type.

CVE-2025-30521,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the provided CVE, we must determine each component based on the description:

- **AV (Attack Vector):** Since this is a request forgery issue which likely can be sent by an attacker without necessarily being forced to interact with the target system directly or through another user, it's reasonable to categorize it as ""Network"" or more specifically, ""Adjacent"". Given that there's no mention of forceful interaction and considering typical definitions, let's select ""Network"".
- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Cross-Site Request Forgery typically requires no advanced skills. It often involves tricking the user into making unintended actions on a website they're already authenticated to, which is usually achievable with basic knowledge. Therefore, the complexity is classified as ""Low"".
- **PR (Privileges Required):** The vulnerability exploits CSRF, which generally does not require elevated privileges and relies on the lack of protection against such attacks for its effect. This makes it ""None"" since no additional privileges are needed.
- **UI (User Interaction):** Although traditional CSRF may rely on user interaction to be successful, this specific scenario allows bypassing without direct human interaction by sending a malicious request programmatically. Therefore, we classify it as ""None"".
- **S (Scope):** Since this vulnerability can affect any web application not properly secured against cross-site request forgery at the time of exploitation and given that its full scope isn't detailed, let's classify it as ""Unchanged"" as there's no mention of the attack potentially changing or expanding past the specific target being exploited.
- **C (Confidentiality):** This vulnerability affects a user's privacy in terms of actions taken on their behalf without their consent. Hence, we rate it ""High"".
- **I (Integrity):** By causing unintended actions to be performed by another party using the victim's authenticated session, this attack compromises the integrity of user data and possibly other system resources. This makes it ""High"".
- **A (Availability):** While there isn't explicit mention that this vulnerability directly affects availability or results in denial-of-service conditions immediately upon successful exploitation, allowing an attacker to bypass CSRF protection could lead to a situation where the victim's session might be used inappropriately by others without their knowledge. This somewhat complicates direct categorization under typical definitions but leans towards ""High"" due to potential indirect impacts.

CVE-2025-30525,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to identify its corresponding attack vector (AV), attack complexity (AC), privileges required (PR), user interaction (UI), scope (S), confidentiality impact (C), integrity impact (I), and availability impact (A).

Based on the provided information:

- Attack Vector: Network is not explicitly mentioned. However, since it's an SQL Injection vulnerability in a web application, it likely involves Remote.
- Attack Complexity: The description mentions ""Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command,"" which can be considered High complexity because it implies the attacker needs some amount of skill to find and exploit this issue effectively.
- Privileges Required: Since the user can potentially inject SQL commands without requiring privileges, but the application is already vulnerable due to a configuration or software choice, we may assume Medium (High) or Low depending on the specific case. But given the lack of specificity in privileges required, it's reasonable to consider this as ""None"" for simplicity.
- User Interaction: The attack does not require user interaction since an attacker can inject SQL commands without needing the user to do anything.
- Scope: This vulnerability impacts 'Confidentiality' (C), 'Integrity' (I) and is 'Unchanged'.
- Confidentiality Impact: High due to potential sensitive data exposure through SQL Injection.
- Integrity Impact: High because any modifications made by an attacker can lead to unauthorized changes or deletion of data.
- Availability Impact: None as this vulnerability does not affect the availability of a system.

CVE Description: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in lucksy Typekit plugin for WordPress allows Cross Site Request Forgery. This issue affects Typekit plugin for WordPress: from n/a through 1.2.3.

Based on the information, we can assign the following values:

- **AV**: Network, as it's a network-based attack vector.
- **AC**: High, because CSRF attacks often involve manipulating user interactions to perform actions without authorization.
- **PR**: None, as there is no specific mention of privileges required for exploiting this vulnerability.
- **UI**: None, since the attack can be carried out remotely and does not require user interaction on a targeted host.
- **S**: Unchanged (U), because even though the plugin has an outdated version that's vulnerable, updating it won't change its scope.
- **C**: High, as the primary impact is related to confidentiality, allowing unauthorized access or actions for malicious actors.
- **I**: None, since the vulnerability primarily involves potential information disclosure and lack of integrity protection against unauthorized modification.
- **A**: Low (L), because the availability of a WordPress plugin's functionality isn't directly impacted; however, this could be considered depending on context. Given the lack of information on availability being directly affected by this, we'll default to L for consistency.

From the description, we can infer the following:

- **AV:** The attack vector is Local (L), as it allows exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels without requiring network access.
  
- **AC:** The attack complexity is High (H) due to the presence of a missing authorization vulnerability. This indicates that an attacker only needs to execute a single malicious action or call to exploit the flaw.

- **PR:** Privileges Required is None (N), as there's no indication that exploiting this vulnerability would require elevated privileges beyond normal user levels.

- **UI:** User Interaction is None (N), since the vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any direct interaction from an attacker, such as clicking a link or executing a script.

- **S:** The scope of the vulnerability is Unchanged (U), as there's no indication that this would allow an attacker to access different resources beyond what was originally intended for Menu Duplicator.

- **C:** Confidentiality Impact is Low (L) since exploiting this vulnerability primarily impacts the integrity and availability aspects without directly compromising user data or communications, implying minimal impact on confidentiality.

- **I:** Integrity Impact is High (H), as there's a possibility that an attacker could manipulate menu items to bypass intended access controls, leading to potential unauthorized actions within Menu Duplicator.

- **A:** Availability Impact is Low (L), because the primary effect of this vulnerability is on the integrity and not on making the application unavailable for normal users.

### Given CVE Details
```markdown
CVE ID: CVE-2025-30563
CVE Description: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in NotFound Tidekey allows Reflected XSS. This issue affects Tidekey: from n/a through 1.1.
```

### Extracted CVSS Values

- **AV**: Given the nature of the vulnerability being a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack, which can occur via an adjacent network attack since the attacker doesn't need to interact with the server directly but only needs access to the web page that's vulnerable.
- **AC**: The complexity is considered Medium due to the fact that it requires exploiting reflected XSS, which can be challenging without knowledge of a target's implementation specifics. However, given no further details on potential mitigations or the lack of any mention that this might require significant setup or exploit development effort (beyond being a 'medium' attack), we default to this classification.
- **PR**: Given this is an XSS vulnerability that affects the end user and doesn't seem directly related to exploiting system services or escalating privileges beyond the web interface, no Privileges Required category applies here. This makes it ""None"" (N).
- **UI**: Since it's a client-side issue affecting user interaction via web pages, User Interaction must be None (N), as users aren't required to do anything specific for this vulnerability to occur.
- **S**: This is a changed scope, given the nature of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities which can affect any user without requiring any further access or actions by them.
- **C**: Confidentiality Impact is High (H) because this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts on the client-side where it has direct access to resources and potentially execute scripts on behalf of logged-in users. However, there's no confidentiality breach on the server side itself in terms of secrets or data that isn't intended for public consumption.
- **I**: The integrity of user data is compromised due to this being an XSS vulnerability which means data can be manipulated without needing physical access to the machine running the application. Therefore, the integrity of data affected is High (H).
- **A**: Although an attacker could use this vulnerability to inject malicious content that affects users' browsing experience and potentially allows for lateral movement or escalating privileges indirectly if exploited correctly, there's no guarantee the system will be taken down due to this alone. However, without more information on how potential exploits might affect availability, we default to High (H) due to the potential disruptive impact of this vulnerability.

### CVSS Vector

```plaintext
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:M/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/I:H/A:H
```

This indicates an attack vector (`N`) that can occur from adjacent networks, a medium complexity (`M`) of attacking the application (given no specific exploits were needed and it's more complex than some lower categories), ""none"" privileges required for the exploit, user interaction is not necessary to exploit this vulnerability (`N`), the scope changes with each potential victim affected by a single malicious script injection across all users without needing additional access or interactions from them. Confidentiality (`H`) and integrity (`H`) are impacted due to the nature of reflected XSS allowing scripts to be executed on behalf of users, affecting user data directly, but availability is considered High as well since while it disrupts functionality, it doesn't necessarily halt system operation entirely due to its reliance on client-side execution."

CVE-2025-30567,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, I'll break down the attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, scope, confidentiality, integrity, and availability based on the provided information.

- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent (A) is chosen because it indicates that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability from the same system.
- Attack Complexity (AC): Medium (M) would be ideal, but since the description doesn't explicitly mention complexity, I'll choose High (H) based on the severity of the vulnerability described as 'Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')', which suggests potential for significant exploitation.
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) is selected because the impact of this path traversal vulnerability doesn't seem to require any specific elevated privileges to exploit, but in the absence of more information, it's chosen as 'None'.
- User Interaction (UI): None (N) is assumed since the attack may occur without direct user interaction.
- Scope (S): Changed (C) is selected because this issue affects the directory traversal allowing unauthorized access or modifications, which is a change from the original restricted path.
- Confidentiality (C): High (H) is chosen due to the nature of path traversal vulnerabilities often affecting sensitive data paths or leading to potential data exposure.
- Integrity (I): High (H) is selected because such vulnerabilities may allow malicious alterations to files, potentially compromising data integrity.
- Availability (A): None (N) is assumed since the impact on availability seems significant but might not necessarily be immediately apparent without more information.

CVE-2025-30573,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we'll analyze the description and match it to the corresponding CVSS categories:

- **AV:** The attack vector is Adjacent (A) because the vulnerability allows Stored XSS attacks without requiring any user interaction or network connection. Therefore, the AV should be set to A.

- **AC:** Given that the CVE mentions ""Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"" which implies a moderate difficulty in exploiting this issue, we'll choose High Attack Complexity (H).

- **PR:** There is no mention of privileges being required for this vulnerability. Therefore, Privileges Required should be set to None (N).

- **UI:** As there's no interaction with the user required for an attack to occur, and the system itself can be compromised remotely through a web page, we choose No User Interaction.

- **S:** This is a Stored XSS Vulnerability, which means the vulnerability allows attackers to store and execute malicious code in the affected application. Therefore, the Scope should be Changed (C).

- **C:** Confidentiality is Low (L) since the issue does not directly expose sensitive information but rather enables an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

- **I:** Integrity is High (H) because the ability to inject scripts into the site's content impacts the system's integrity, making it vulnerable to data corruption and potential manipulation of user input.

- **A:** Given that we have High Impact on both Confidentiality and Integrity, but no mention of impact on Availability, and assuming the system remains operational despite this vulnerability, we choose High (H).

CVSS:3.1/AV:S/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/I:L/A:N

Here's my reasoning for each component of the vector:

- AV (Attack Vector): The attack is not launched from within the network (S), but rather remotely by exploiting a vulnerable web application, making it ""S"" (Speculative).

- AC (Attack Complexity): Given that this vulnerability requires an attacker to trick users into performing unintended actions via malicious links sent through CopyLink and is only applicable when a user is logged in or has cookies set for the CopyLink domain, making the attack more complex.

- PR (Privileges Required): The attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability, but rather they can use the legitimate features of the application to perform actions on behalf of the current user.

- UI (User Interaction): No user interaction is required since the link is sent as a response to another action taken by the user, making it ""N"" (None).

- S (Scope): The attack only affects information stored on the web server that receives requests from CopyLink clients.

- C (Confidentiality): The vulnerability primarily results in a potential for unauthorized access to sensitive information that the application stores.

- I (Integrity): Since an attacker can use this vulnerability to manipulate users into performing actions that may lead to the compromise of sensitive information, this affects the integrity of data stored on web servers.

- A (Availability): This does not directly affect availability but is related to it because the attack might be launched remotely and without user interaction which could impact how resources are allocated."
CVE-2025-30604,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to determine each component based on the provided description:

- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent (A) is indicated as 'Blind SQL Injection', which typically involves a user being tricked into executing an action that leads to the vulnerability without needing direct access to the target.
- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) due to the complexity of Blind SQL Injection, which requires sophisticated knowledge and tools for exploitation.
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N), as this type of attack does not require any privileges to be exploited by an attacker, other than possibly accessing a vulnerable application or system.
- User Interaction (UI): None (N) since the attack can be launched remotely without user interaction.
- Scope (S): Changed (C), indicating that access is granted to different data based on user input in SQL Injection attacks.
- Confidentiality (C): High (H), as SQL Injection can potentially expose sensitive information stored in databases.
- Integrity (I): Low (L), because the vulnerability primarily affects data integrity by allowing unauthorized modifications, but may not necessarily result in data loss or modification of sensitive data directly. However, it could lead to data corruption depending on the nature and extent of the SQL Injection attack.
- Availability (A): High (H) due to potential impact from successful exploitation that might cause system unavailability.

Given CVE ID: CVE-2025-30623
CVE Description: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Rachel Cherry wA11y – The Web Accessibility Toolbox allows Stored XSS. This issue affects wA11y – The Web Accessibility Toolbox: from n/a through 1.0.3.

Based on the provided components for generating CVSS vectors, we can deduce as follows:

- AV: Adjacent (A) is used because the vulnerability would be exploited by launching a malicious request that's made without user interaction or through some other non-invasive means.
- AC: High (H) is selected due to the complexity of the flaw in terms of exploiting it, which requires careful handling and manipulation of web page content.
- PR: None (N), as no specific privileges need to be escalated for the exploitation to work.
- UI: None (N), since user interaction isn't required for the vulnerability to be exploited; the attack can be automated or carried out without direct human involvement.
- S: Unchanged (U), because even if a web application fixes this vulnerability, it still might remain unchanged in terms of functionality; thus, no changes are made from its original state unless the issue is fixed.
- C: High (H) due to the privacy implications of allowing user input to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of an otherwise trusted web application.
- I: High (H), because compromising the integrity of a website that stores and handles sensitive user data can lead to further unauthorized modifications, loss of data, or worse—unintended system vulnerabilities.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Here's my reasoning for each component of the CVSS vector:

- AV (Attack Vector): Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- AC (Attack Complexity): High (H) - This would require some manual effort to exploit, but the reward could be substantial.
- PR (Privileges Required): Low (L) - To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker only needs Subscriber-level access and above. An attacker would not need to bypass any security mechanism or gain elevated privileges.
- UI (User Interaction): None Required (R) - While there is a certain level of user interaction involved here (the WordPress site is the target), the actual exploitation does not require direct user input; it relies on the actions taken by an administrator who has Subscriber-level access and above. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to trick the user into doing something.
- S (Scope): Changed (C) - The vulnerability will change how options are modified in the WordPress site, particularly if arbitrary options can be updated without proper checks.
- C (Confidentiality): Low (L) - This is because there's no sensitive information being accessed; only capabilities and settings related to user management are being manipulated.
- I (Integrity): Low (L) - The integrity of the site isn't directly affected by this vulnerability. An attacker could manipulate arbitrary options, potentially altering the system's state, but they wouldn't be adding malicious content that would affect the functionality or data integrity in a significant way.
- A (Availability): None (N) - While an attack might temporarily prevent access to some features of the site while exploiting the vulnerability and then reverting back after the update is made, the fundamental availability of the site remains unaffected directly by this vulnerability alone."

CVE-2025-30763,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze the components of the vulnerability:

- Attack Vector: The vulnerability is not specifically stated as Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), or Physical (P). Therefore, it's most likely that this issue is a Network (N) attack.

- Attack Complexity: It's mentioned that the vulnerability allows Stored XSS. When there are arbitrary scripts included in stored content, the complexity of an exploit can be considered as High (H).

- Privileges Required: This is a Cross-site Scripting vulnerability, which implies it doesn't require any special privileges to execute.

- User Interaction: The user does not need to interact with the web application because they do not see the malicious scripts. Therefore, this is UI: None (N).

- Scope: As this issue specifically allows for Stored XSS, and does not have a way of ""changing"" the scope (i.e., it affects the same data without providing additional information), the impact is Unchanged (U).

- Confidentiality: The stored XSS vulnerability affects all user sessions across the web application. It compromises confidentiality by potentially stealing sensitive data or manipulating unauthorized access to personal information. Therefore, this should be High (H) in terms of Confidentiality.

- Integrity: This issue impacts the integrity of the application by allowing malicious scripts to be stored on users' devices without their knowledge. Hence, it should be High (H).

- Availability: Since this is a web application vulnerability, it doesn't inherently impact availability unless there's an extremely large and resource-intensive amount of malicious requests being sent. However, given that the standard impact in such cases isn't ""None"" but rather Low or High, and considering typical implications of XSS vulnerabilities affecting high availability (i.e., potential for denial-of-service attacks), this should be set to High (H) for simplicity.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-30777,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE, we need to break down the description and apply it to the appropriate CVSS 3.1 categories.

AV: Attack Vector
- Network (N): The attack can be initiated remotely over a network.
- Adjacent (A): The attack can be initiated adjacent to the target environment.
- Local (L): The attack can only be initiated locally on the target device itself.
- Physical (P): The attack requires physical access to the target.

Given the description, ""Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in PalsCode Support Genix allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels"" implies that the attacker doesn't need direct interaction with the user or a remote connection; they only need control over the key. This typically means they have physical access or an adjacent point of entry, but without specifying the exact method (like exploiting a service), it's more accurate to categorize this as Local (L) because they can launch the attack on the local host.

AC: Attack Complexity
- Low (L): The attack requires minimal steps and no particular expertise.
- High (H): The attack requires significant planning, expertise, and possibly multiple steps.

The description focuses on bypassing authorization through user-controlled keys without detailing any specific steps or methods. Given this, it leans towards requiring more complexity than just a few steps, suggesting it's High (H).

PR: Privileges Required
- None (N): The attack can be launched by an unauthorized user with no need for additional privileges.
- Low (L): The attacker needs some minimal privileges to execute the attack.
- High (H): The attacker requires significant elevated privileges or access to execute the attack.

The description does not mention needing specific privileges, indicating it doesn't require any beyond what's already in place. This suggests it can be launched with no additional privileges needed, categorizing this as None (N).

UI: User Interaction
- None (N): The attacker is not required to interact with the user.
- Required (R): The attacker must interact with a human user.

The description does not imply interaction with any user; thus, it's categorized as No interaction (None, N) for this field.

S: Scope
- Unchanged (U): The attack does not change the target environment or data.
- Changed (C): The attack results in a change to the target environment or data.

Given that the description implies a vulnerability bypass allowing exploitation of ""Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels,"" which suggests some sort of security breach leading to possible changes, this leans towards a Change (C).

C: Confidentiality
- None (N): The attack does not compromise confidentiality.
- Low (L): The attack compromises low-level data or information that is not sensitive.
- High (H): The attack significantly compromises the confidentiality of sensitive data.

The description indicates an authorization bypass, suggesting potential breaches but doesn't specify whether it's related to data confidentiality directly. This would be classified as None (N) based on the provided description alone, focusing more on access control and authorization than specific data confidentiality.

I: Integrity
- None (N): The attack does not compromise integrity.
- Low (L): The attack compromises low-level data or information that is not critical.
- High (H): The attack significantly compromises the integrity of critical data.

Similar to Confidentiality, without explicit mention of compromising integrity due to sensitive data, we lean towards this also being None (N).

A: Availability
- None (N): The attack does not impact the availability of the target system.
- Low (L): The attack impacts low-level functionality or services that are not critical to overall system availability.
- High (H): The attack significantly impacts the overall availability of the system.

Again, without explicit mention of impacting the availability due to sensitive data, this leans towards None (N).

- AV: Attack Vector - Given that the description mentions Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability and does not specify any specifics on how an attacker would exploit this, a good choice is 'N' as ""Network"" is the most suitable option.
- AC: Attack Complexity - The severity of a CVSS vector can be represented by its attack complexity. Since it's Cross-Site Request Forgery, which generally requires some manipulation or tricking of the user to achieve, we'll select ""H"" for High attack complexity.
- PR: Privileges Required - This vulnerability does not seem to specify any level of privileges required to exploit the issue, thus a suitable choice is 'N' (None) as it implies no special privileges are necessary.
- UI: User Interaction - Given that CSRF exploits often do not require direct user interaction and can be triggered by a malicious request, we'll choose ""N"" (None) for this component.
- S: Scope - Since the impact of the issue is only within wpShopGermany IT-RECHT KANZLEI itself and does not affect other systems or networks in any way, the most appropriate option is 'C' (Changed).
- C: Confidentiality - CSRF generally affects confidentiality as it manipulates user data to make unauthorized requests, thus we'll select ""H"" for High.
- I: Integrity - The integrity might be affected by allowing an attacker to manipulate wpShopGermany IT-RECHT KANZLEI. However, given that this isn't the primary concern here (as confidentiality takes precedence), and there's a lack of information about its effect on data itself, we can safely say ""N"" for None.
- A: Availability - Considering the impact of CSRF is mainly affecting availability by making wpShopGermany IT-RECHT KANZLEI potentially vulnerable to attacks leading to loss of service or functionality, it seems like a good fit for High Availability.

CVE-2025-30817,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE ID and description, I'll break down the components based on the information given in the description.

Given:
- The vulnerability is classified as a ""Missing Authorization"" issue.
- It exploits ""Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.""
- This impacts versions of Z Companion from ""n/a"" through 1.0.13.

Based on this, we can identify:

- **AV (Attack Vector)**: Since the attack could be launched without being able to obtain access on a network or physical system but requires privileges with user interaction for an effective exploit, it should be classified as ""Adjacent"". There is no information about the vulnerability requiring local access or not. Given this interpretation and based on typical CVSS documentation where ""Network"" implies remote launch over a network which does not fit our context, ""Adjacent"" seems more appropriate than ""N"".

- **AC (Attack Complexity)**: This would be classified as ""High"" due to the nature of missing authorization which is generally considered to require significant effort or resources for exploitation.

- **PR (Privileges Required)**: Given that it requires exploiting an issue with access control, we'd categorize this as requiring ""Low"" privileges since it doesn't necessarily demand elevated privileges beyond what's needed to exploit an incorrectly configured access control mechanism.

- **UI (User Interaction)**: The description mentions exploitation of a configuration which inherently involves user interaction (""Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels""). Therefore, the attack would require user interaction.

- **S (Scope)**: Since this issue only affects versions of Z Companion from ""n/a"" through 1.0.13 and there's no indication it expands beyond those versions, the scope is considered as ""Unchanged"".

- **C (Confidentiality)**: Missing authorization vulnerabilities typically affect confidentiality since they exploit weaknesses in access control.

- **I (Integrity)**: Given that it primarily affects the integrity of the system by allowing unauthorized access or actions due to incorrectly configured security levels, this would also be a valid concern.

- **A (Availability)**: The primary effect of such a vulnerability is on availability as it directly impacts the ability of the system to secure its resources properly.

Therefore, based on these interpretations:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-3082,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze the description and assign values based on the provided components:

- Attack Vector (AV):
  - Adjacent (A): The exploit can be launched from the same local machine or a nearby network.

- Attack Complexity (AC):
  - High (H): Due to the nature of the vulnerability, which involves manipulating collation settings to access unintended data, it is considered complex to exploit.

- Privileges Required (PR):
  - Low (L): The attacker needs only minimal privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

- User Interaction (UI):
  - None (N): This vulnerability does not require user interaction; the issue can be exploited passively by manipulating system settings.

- Scope (S):
  - Changed (C): This is a changed scope, as exploiting the vulnerability would allow access to data intended for a different view or collation setting.

- Confidentiality (C):
  - High (H): The exploit allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- Integrity (I):
  - Low (L): While there's some risk of data modification through this means, it is considered low since the attacker must exploit system settings to do so, and the intent seems more about accessing rather than modifying sensitive data at a low privilege level.

- Availability (A):
  - High (H): The vulnerability could lead to higher availability for an attacker by allowing them access to previously restricted views or data on MongoDB servers.

Therefore, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-3082 is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H"

CVE-2025-30821,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze the provided information:

- Attack Vector (AV): The description mentions a missing authorization vulnerability, which is likely an attack within the network or adjacent. However, without explicit mention of it being remote or local, I'll choose Network (N) as it's more common and safer.
- Attack Complexity (AC): This should be High (H) due to the missing authorization which might require deeper analysis to exploit effectively.
- Privileges Required (PR): Since the vulnerability allows for accessing functionality not properly constrained by ACLs, this would likely be None (N).
- User Interaction (UI): There is no direct interaction mentioned, but it's possible some interaction could have occurred. I'll choose None (N) as it is a safer assumption.
- Scope (S): The scope should be Changed (C) because the issue affects functionality that is not properly constrained by ACLs, potentially changing how the system functions or behaves.
- Confidentiality (C): This vulnerability likely involves confidentiality, so I'll choose High (H).
- Integrity (I): It might affect integrity if data was being altered without authorization. Given the lack of explicit information on this aspect and to be cautious, I will select Low (L).
- Availability (A): There is no direct mention of how availability is affected. Without this information, it's best to default to None (N), assuming the vulnerability might not necessarily result in an immediate loss of service.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/I:N/A:N

Here's my explanation for each component of the CVSS Vector:

- AV (Attack Vector): Network (N) - The exploit requires network access to be effective.
- AC (Attack Complexity): Low (L) - The attack is relatively simple and straightforward, as it involves a CSRF vulnerability that can be exploited through user input.
- PR (Privileges Required): None (N) - No elevated privileges are required for the attacker to execute this exploit.
- UI (User Interaction): None (N) - User interaction is not required for the vulnerability to be exploitable. The exploit relies on crafted data being sent via HTTP requests.
- S (Scope): Changed (C) - As the issue affects a custom login logo, it could potentially allow an attacker to execute unauthorized actions related to user authentication and profile management.
- C (Confidentiality): None (N) - This vulnerability does not directly impact sensitive information or affect data confidentiality.
- I (Integrity): None (N) - The exploit primarily targets the integrity of user sessions rather than altering system data itself.
- A (Availability): None (N) - Although it may lead to a temporary denial-of-service situation for affected users, this vulnerability does not inherently make the system less available in terms of access."
CVE-2025-30823,"Based on the CVE description, I would generate the following CVSS 3.1 vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"
CVE-2025-30824,"Based on the provided information and using your guidance I am unable to generate a final answer as I don't have the necessary details to produce an accurate CVSS 3.1 Vector.

However, with your guidance, here is how you can do it:

To determine the CVSS vector for a given CVE, you would follow these steps:
1. **Determine Attack Vector (AV):**
   - Adjacent (A) if the attack target is adjacent to the network interface or on the same system.
   - Network (N) if the attack requires a network connection or uses a network service.
   - Physical (P) if the attack involves physical access to the device, such as an unpatched workstation left on a desk or an exploit that can be triggered with a physical access card.

2. **Determine Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - Low (L) if the method of exploitation is straightforward and does not require special tools or expertise.
   - High (H) if the method of exploitation requires significant skills, specialized knowledge, or extensive use of tools.

3. **Determine Privileges Required (PR):**
   - None (N) if no authentication or authorization mechanism protects access to the system component being targeted.
   - Low (L) if low-level privileges are required to execute the attack successfully.
   - High (H) if high-level privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

4. **Determine User Interaction (UI):**
   - None (N) if no user interaction is needed for exploitation, such as a buffer overflow that does not require user input.
   - Required (R) if the system requires user intervention or action to exploit the vulnerability, such as entering administrative credentials.

5. **Determine Scope (S):**
   - Unchanged (U) if the system component being targeted is unchanged by an attack on the affected system or component.
   - Changed (C) if exploitation of a component can change the behavior of the affected system or component.

6. **Determine Confidentiality (C):**
   - None (N) if the system component being targeted does not contain sensitive information that could be leaked by exploitation.
   - Low (L) if sensitive data is available but not protected at a low level, such as plaintext data.
   - High (H) if sensitive data can be accessed or modified by exploiting the vulnerability.

7. **Determine Integrity (I):**
   - None (N) if the system component being targeted does not contain critical data that could be modified by exploitation.
   - Low (L) if critical data is available but not protected at a low level, such as plaintext data.
   - High (H) if critical data can be accessed or modified by exploiting the vulnerability.

8. **Determine Availability (A):**
   - None (N) if no availability mechanism affects the system component being targeted, such as an exploit that only causes local file modifications but does not impact network connectivity.
   - Low (L) if low-level availability is required to be maintained or restored, such as ensuring a network connection.
   - High (H) if high-level availability is required to be maintained or restored, such as maintaining full network functionality.

Here's how you can generate the CVSS vector for ""CVE-2025-30824"":
1. **Determine Attack Vector (AV):** 
   Since the description does not specifically mention a network connection, Physical access or Adjacent system is assumed.
2. **Determine Attack Complexity (AC):** 
   This information is missing in the description; it could be High if it requires significant skills or specialized knowledge.
3. **Determine Privileges Required (PR):** 
   It's mentioned that Missing Authorization vulnerability, implying no authentication mechanism protects access.
4. **Determine User Interaction (UI):** 
   No user interaction is needed for Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels; it is purely automated or remote exploitation.
5. **Determine Scope (S):** 
   This issue affects Textmetrics: from n/a through 3.6.1, indicating the affected component's behavior may change by exploiting this vulnerability.
6. **Determine Confidentiality (C):** 
   It could be Low since sensitive data is available but not protected at a low level in some configurations or High if sensitive data can be accessed or modified by exploiting the vulnerability.
7. **Determine Integrity (I):** 
   This information is missing in the description; it could be High as the issue affects Critical Data Access/Modification, which requires high-level protection.
8. **Determine Availability (A):** 
   It may be Low since some availability mechanisms might be impacted or High if full network functionality must be maintained.

With this approach, a CVSS 3.1 vector for ""CVE-2025-30824"" could look like:

CVE-2025-30839,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to break down the description into its components according to the CVSS 3.1 guidelines.

- **AV**: Attack Vector - The attack vector is not specified in the given description, but based on typical CVSS ratings, I will assign it as 'N' (Network) since there's no information about a local or physical attack.
  
- **AC**: Attack Complexity - Although the description doesn't explicitly mention complexity, given that the issue affects authorization and security levels without specifying any specific steps required to exploit this, I would rate it as 'H' (High) because complex attacks often involve more nuanced exploitation than described here.

- **PR**: Privileges Required - Since the description states ""Missing Authorization vulnerability,"" which suggests not having proper permissions or access controls in place, I'll assume that no privileges are needed to exploit this, thus making it 'N'.

- **UI**: User Interaction - Given the nature of an authorization vulnerability, the attack is likely to be non-interactive. This is consistent with a rating of 'N' (None).

- **S**: Scope - The scope here isn't explicitly defined in the description, but since it's about missing or incorrectly configured access control security levels, I'll assume that this issue affects 'C' (Changed) since any system impacted by such a vulnerability likely has its configuration altered.

- **C**: Confidentiality - Since authorization primarily deals with permissions and access to resources rather than data confidentiality, the impact would be 'N' (None).

- **I**: Integrity - The primary concern here is not about data integrity but about ensuring that only authorized users can make changes. Thus, this should also be 'N'.

- **A**: Availability - Given the focus on authorization and security levels, the availability of critical services might be impacted if a user manages to exploit this correctly, making it 'L' (Low).

CVE-2025-3085,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-3085, we need to analyze the provided description and match it with the corresponding CVSS vector components.

Based on the given information:

- **AV (Attack Vector):** The attack may be launched remotely, which means the attack vector is Network (N).
- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Since CRL revocation status checking must be enabled for MongoDB Server running on Linux, it indicates that the configuration is set to check the revocation status of intermediate certificates in the peer's certificate chain. This suggests an Attack Complexity of High (H).
- **PR (Privileges Required):** Given that this issue may lead to improper authentication and intra-cluster authentication is affected, no specific privileges are required for exploitation.
- **UI (User Interaction):** The attack can be launched remotely without requiring user interaction, so the User Interaction is None (N).
- **S (Scope):** Since this vulnerability may affect MongoDB Server intra-cluster authentication in addition to a potential improper authentication issue, it indicates a Changed (C) scope.
- **C (Confidentiality):** This vulnerability may lead to improper authentication and potentially affects confidential information. Therefore, Confidentiality is High (H).
- **I (Integrity):** The integrity of the system may also be affected by this vulnerability, which is indicated by an impact on intra-cluster authentication.
- **A (Availability):** Although the impact on availability isn't explicitly mentioned, if the MongoDB Server fails to check the revocation status of intermediate certificates, it could potentially lead to service unavailability or denial of access. Hence, Availability is High (H).

Therefore, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-3085 is:
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:H"

CVE-2025-30853,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the provided CVE, I'll analyze the given description and match it with the corresponding components of the vector.

Given the description: ""Missing Authorization vulnerability in ShortPixel ShortPixel Adaptive Images allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.""

- The attack vector is Adjacent (A) because it does not require network access.
- Attack complexity is Medium (M). However, since there's no direct information about how complex this vulnerability is, I will use High (H).
- There are some privileges involved, but the description states ""Allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control,"" which implies that there might be specific configurations in place. Therefore, Privileges Required will likely be None (N) because exploiting it doesn't seem to involve any special permissions.
- User Interaction is Required (R) because you need some user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.
- The scope of the vulnerability isn’t specified directly, but given its description and lack of information on how the vulnerability works at a deeper level without specifying network access as an option, it’s reasonable to infer that it could be Unchanged or Changed (U/C). However, since we know there's no network required but might not affect the image immediately, I'll choose Changed (C).
- Confidentiality is affected because it's related to security levels and unauthorized access. Given this information, High (H) seems appropriate.
- Integrity is also affected due to the nature of the vulnerability being in authorization levels, leading to potential manipulation at a higher level than just the data itself. So, High (H) is chosen here as well.
- Availability isn't directly mentioned but since we're dealing with an image that might be exploited for security reasons without any indication of its impact on availability when accessed normally or otherwise, I'll default to No Impact (N).

CVE-2025-30879,"Based on the CVE description provided, I will analyze and generate the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector.

Since the description mentions SQL Injection, which is an attack on confidentiality (C), but does not mention any information about data loss or modification, I will assign AC:H for High Attack Complexity.

There are no user interactions mentioned in the description, so UI:N.

The scope of this issue remains unchanged as it's a client-side vulnerability that doesn't involve server-side changes. So S:C.

Since this is a SQL Injection attack, which affects confidentiality, I will assign C:L for Low Confidentiality.

As there is no information about data integrity being compromised, I will assign I:N.

The availability of the system remains unchanged as there's no mention of any impact on the system's functionality or performance. So A:N.

With these factors considered, I generate the CVSS vector:

CVE-2025-30880,"Based on the provided CVE description, I will analyze the vulnerability and assign a suitable CVSS 3.1 vector.

After analyzing the CVE description, I have determined that:

- The attack vector is Adjacent (A), as the exploitation relies on an adjacent or nearby system being vulnerable.
- Attack Complexity is Low (L), because the exploitation involves relatively simple actions, such as exploiting incorrectly configured access control security levels.
- Privileges Required are None (N), since no special privileges are required for the exploit to succeed.
- User Interaction is Not applicable (N), since this vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction.
- Scope is Changed (C), because the vulnerability affects a system component.
- Confidentiality is High (H), as the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access of sensitive information.
- Integrity is High (H), because the vulnerability could result in modification or destruction of data.
- Availability is Low (L), since the exploitation may have impact on availability.

Therefore, the CVSS 3.1 vector for this CVE is:
 
CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/I:H/A:L"
CVE-2025-30881,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to identify and match it with the corresponding components from the provided list:

- AV: Attack Vector
- AC: Attack Complexity
- PR: Privileges Required
- UI: User Interaction
- S: Scope
- C: Confidentiality
- I: Integrity
- A: Availability

Based on the description of CVE-2025-30881, we can infer as follows:

- AV: The vulnerability is missing authorization in ThemeHunk Big Store. Therefore, it's likely that this is an **Adjacent (A)** attack vector because a user with access to a network could exploit it without needing direct access.

- AC: The description does not specify any particular complexity required or involved in the exploitation process. Hence, for simplicity, we can assign **Low (L)** as the attack complexity.

- PR: There is no specification of privileges needed to exploit this vulnerability. So, it's reasonable to assume that it requires **None (N) privileges**.

- UI: There is no mention of user interaction in the description. Therefore, it should be **None (N)/** user interaction.

- S: The scope is likely to be ""Unchanged (U)"" since there isn't information provided about whether the vulnerability changes existing data or alters network connections significantly.

- C: This is a confidentiality issue, and given that this could potentially allow unauthorized access or manipulation of user data, we should assign **High (H)** level confidentiality.

- I: As the described vulnerability involves missing authorization for storing data, it impacts data integrity. Therefore, assigning **High (H)** level integrity seems reasonable.

- A: The availability might be somewhat affected as this could potentially make a system or process more vulnerable to malicious actions, but without explicit mention of service disruption or failure, we can still choose **Low (L)/** availability.

Now, let's compile the vector according to CVSS 3.1 format and its corresponding components:

- Attack Complexity (AC): The missing authorization vulnerability allows for exploiting incorrectly configured access control security levels, indicating a level of difficulty in performing the attack, so AC would be Low (L).

- Privileges Required (PR): Since the description mentions ""Missing Authorization"" and not specifically requiring privileges to exploit, this is None (N).

- User Interaction (UI): There's no indication that user interaction is required for exploitation, making UI:None (N) appropriate.

- Scope (S): The vulnerability affects WpEvently from version n/a through 4.2.9, indicating a changed scope, so S would be Changed (C).

- Confidentiality (C): Since the exploit does not necessarily involve accessing sensitive data that requires confidentiality to access, this would also be None (N).

- Integrity (I): The missing authorization vulnerability likely allows for modification of security levels or configurations without needing to read or write data, suggesting a high level of integrity threat, so I would be High (H).

- Availability (A): Since the impact on availability isn't directly stated but considering the nature of a missing authorization vulnerability could potentially lead to broader issues affecting system availability indirectly, it's reasonable to classify this as a Low (L) threat.

CVE ID: CVE-2025-30894
CVE Description: Missing Authorization vulnerability in Epsiloncool WP Fast Total Search allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels. This issue affects WP Fast Total Search: from n/a through 1.79.262.

Applying the CVSS vector components:

Vector Components:
- AV: Attack Vector [Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P)]
Since there's no mention of network interaction in the vulnerability description, we'll choose Network (N) for the attack vector.
  
- AC: Attack Complexity [Low (L), High (H)]
The description implies that authorization vulnerabilities are common and can be exploited by an attacker. Thus, high complexity is suitable.

- PR: Privileges Required [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
Since the vulnerability involves missing authorization, it's likely to require minimal privileges to exploit, making None (N) appropriate for the privilege required.

- UI: User Interaction [None (N), Required (R)]
Exploiting a missing authorization vulnerability typically does not require user interaction. Therefore, None (N) is chosen here.

- S: Scope [Unchanged (U), Changed (C)]
As this vulnerability affects access control in search functionality and may potentially affect multiple areas of the application or system (even if not fully disclosed), it can be considered changed. Thus, scope is Changed (C).

- C: Confidentiality [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
This is an authorization issue, implying that confidentiality is compromised. However, since we are dealing with a missing configuration and not direct access to sensitive information, Low (L) seems more appropriate.

- I: Integrity [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
Missing the proper configuration for access control affects integrity as this could lead to unintended actions being taken, impacting system or data integrity. Thus, High (H) is chosen here.

- A: Availability [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
The vulnerability might affect availability depending on the severity and effectiveness of the exploit. It can be considered Low (L) since it doesn't necessarily indicate immediate complete unavailability but rather potential performance impact or inability to function as expected under certain configurations.

CVE-2025-30899,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE ID, we'll follow the standard format and extract the corresponding components from the CVE description.


First, let's identify the relevant components:

- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent (A) or Network (N), since the issue affects User Registration: from n/a through 4.0.3.
- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H), given that the issue is described as 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation.'
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N), because there's no mention of specific privileges required.
- User Interaction (UI): None (N) or Not Applicable (NA), but since user interaction isn't explicitly mentioned, we'll choose UI:None (N).
- Scope (S): Unchanged (U), as it doesn't indicate any scope changes due to the vulnerability.
- Confidentiality (C): Low (L), because while there's a 'Cross-site Scripting' vulnerability involved, typically such vulnerabilities don't compromise confidentiality directly.
- Integrity (I): High (H), since this issue impacts the integrity of user data by allowing stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Availability (A): None (N), as there is no indication that the availability of the service would be impacted.

Putting these components together, we get:

CVE-2025-30906,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE description, I will analyze it based on the available information about the components of the CVSS 3.1 scoring system. Here's my analysis:

- Attack Vector (AV): Local (L)
The vector does not specify a network or physical attack, but given that this is a web application vulnerability and potentially can be exploited remotely by an attacker who has access to the server, it is more likely than other options.

- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H)
Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation indicates a high complexity because it's about exploiting a common web framework weakness which could lead to further issues like cross-site scripting attacks, therefore it demands higher complexity for execution.

- Privileges Required (PR): None (N)
Since this is an application running on the same machine and accessing the same resources, there are no privileges required, as it does not require any elevated access levels or special user permissions.

- User Interaction (UI): Required (R)
This vulnerability may potentially be triggered when a user visits a website that includes malicious JavaScript code. The user interaction here refers to how the attacker would execute the attack - through a user visiting a vulnerable webpage.

- Scope (S): Changed (C)
The plugin affects from version n/a through 1.7.3, so it has affected and possibly continues to affect certain users or machines which have this installed.

- Confidentiality (C): High (H)
This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability - the attacker could steal data or potentially inject malicious code into websites that the infected user visits.

- Integrity (I): Low (L)
The integrity of the website could be affected, as the script can alter content and functionality on websites.

- Availability (A): None (N)
The availability would not be impacted by this attack because it is a data exposure rather than an unavailability issue.

CVE-2025-30908,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-30908 based on its description, let's break down the information into categories:

- **AV:** Attack Vector: This is Local (L) because the vulnerability allows an attacker to launch a successful attack without needing to exploit a shared machine or network service.

- **AC:** Attack Complexity: This is Medium (M). Without further details on how the exploit works, we can reasonably assume it's not trivial but also not extremely complex, hence medium.

- **PR:** Privileges Required: None Required (N) because this vulnerability does not require any additional privileges to be exploited. The attacker only needs to trick a user into making the malicious request.

- **UI:** User Interaction: Required (R). This is because to exploit this vulnerability, a user must interact with the malicious website or email in some way.

- **S:** Scope: Changed (C) since it's now possible for an attacker to affect data on the targeted system that was not available before.

- **C:** Confidentiality: High (H). The attack is designed to steal sensitive information, so this vulnerability has high impact on confidentiality.

- **I:** Integrity: Medium (M). Similar reasoning as above about the complexity of the exploit and its intended effect; it affects integrity but doesn't seem too complex.

- **A:** Availability: None (N) since this does not affect the availability of systems or data in any way.

CVE-2025-30910,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, I'll break down the vulnerability description and map it to the corresponding CVSS 3.1 metric components.

CVSS:3.1/AV:X/AC:X/PR:X/UI:X/S:X/C:X/I:X/A:X

Components:

- AV: Attack Vector [Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P)]
The vulnerability allows ""Path Traversal"", which implies the attacker can access files outside the intended directory. Therefore, the attack vector is ""Network"" since it's not limited to a specific point.

- AC: Attack Complexity [Low (L), High (H)]
Given the CVE description, there's no indication of complex calculations or code injection involved in exploiting this vulnerability. The impact of path traversal vulnerabilities typically doesn't require extensive effort to exploit. Hence, I would classify the attack complexity as ""High"".

- PR: Privileges Required [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
This issue allows an attacker to manipulate paths to access files outside the restricted directory, which suggests a high privilege escalation risk. However, without direct implications of escalating privileges beyond accessing arbitrary files due to path traversal, I would initially lean towards ""Low"".

- UI: User Interaction [None (N), Required (R)]
The description mentions ""Improper Limitation of a Pathname"" indicating an attack vector that does not necessarily require user interaction for the initial exploit. However, the exploitation may be triggered by some form of user activity or external trigger. Thus, I lean towards ""Required"" to account for potential indirect interaction.

- S: Scope [Unchanged (U), Changed (C)]
Since this is a path traversal vulnerability and there's no indication that file contents are being modified or any data is being written outside its intended location due to the nature of the exploit, it suggests an attack that changes the scope in terms of allowed paths. Hence, I would select ""Changed"".

- C: Confidentiality [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
The primary risk associated with this vulnerability lies in the access it allows beyond the intended path, which typically relates to confidentiality risks due to potentially accessing sensitive data or files outside their intended location.

- I: Integrity [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
Similar to the previous point, since we're dealing with path traversal vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary file access without modification of the data itself but merely accessing it, integrity isn't directly impacted in terms of modification risk. However, if a sensitive file is accessed due to this exploit, there's an indirect integrity risk.

- A: Availability [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
The primary impact here could be availability since any successful path traversal could lead to unexpected behavior or even system crashes, affecting the functionality of the service. However, without direct indications of availability risks like denial-of-service attacks leading to complete unavailability, I lean towards ""Low"".

Given these considerations:

- AV: Network
- AC: High
- PR: Low
- UI: Required
- S: Changed
- C: High
- I: Low
- A: Low

Given the CVE Description:
""Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Rometheme RomethemeKit For Elementor allows Command Injection. This issue affects RomethemeKit For Elementor: from n/a through 1.5.4.""

We can determine the vector as follows:

- AV: The attack vector for a code injection vulnerability affecting software installed on a network-connected system is N (Network).
- AC: Given it's an improper control of generation of code, the complexity would be H (High) because it involves manipulating system code which likely requires significant privileges to execute, indicating a high level of difficulty.
- PR: The issue allows Command Injection, which suggests that the attacker needs some privileges. However, considering the vector for ""Privileges Required"" is N (None), we select this as the best choice given the options available in the context of a network vulnerability impacting software with potential but unspecified system-level permissions. In practice, without more detailed information on what these 'system-level' permissions are or how they're used by the attacker, it's hard to definitively categorize them higher.
- UI: This is N (None), as there's no user interaction required; the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- S: Given that it affects software installed on a network-connected host and we don't know its exact impact but can reasonably assume it at least impacts confidentiality or integrity, S would typically be C for Changed. However, in practice, vulnerabilities often change more than just their scope, but without explicit details, this choice is somewhat conservative.
- C: Given the lack of information on data privacy implications (e.g., if any), we're forced to default to N (None) due to a lack of detailed information provided in the vulnerability description about potential confidentiality impacts. This would typically be H for High Confidentiality if more specific details were available but are not here.
- I: Given there's no explicit mention of data being modified or accessed without permission, choosing L seems somewhat cautious as we're dealing with a 'change' scope implication.
- A: Without information on whether the system remains operational in case of an attack and considering typical scenarios for such vulnerabilities impacting software installed on hosts (which would be expected to remain available), this could lean towards N (None) given the lack of further details, though typically, for many types of attacks impacting availability like these, there's at least some probability or expectation that the system might become unavailable during an attack.

Thus, the CVSS 3.1 vector based on the above analysis is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/I:L/A:N"

The vulnerability is described as ""Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"". Based on this information:

- The Attack Vector (AV) is Remote (N), since Reflected XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts in the context of the web application, regardless of whether they're from the same or another network.
- The Attack Complexity (AC) is High (H), because Cross-site Scripting can be executed remotely by injecting a specific type of code into the page content. This requires some level of programming knowledge and exploitation expertise, as it involves manipulating the page's content to execute malicious scripts.
- Privileges Required (PR) are None (N), since there is no mention that an attacker needs specific permissions or access rights to exploit this vulnerability.
- User Interaction (UI) is None (N), because the Cross-site Scripting vulnerability can be exploited through a web request without requiring any user interaction with the application.
- The Scope (S) of the vulnerability affects only the local host, as indicated by Reflected XSS.
- Confidentiality (C) is High (H) because this vulnerability exploits user data and manipulates it to inject malicious scripts into the page content.
- Integrity (I) is also High (H), since the vulnerability can lead to the modification of critical user data in order to make the system susceptible to a Remote Code Execution attack, thus compromising its integrity.
- Availability (A) remains Low (L), as the impact on the availability of the application due to this vulnerability does not seem significant or extensive enough to justify marking it as High.

CVE-2025-31086,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, I will follow these steps:

1. Determine Attack Vector (AV): 
Since the vulnerability is related to Reflected XSS and can be launched remotely without requiring access to the target system's local file system or network resources. Therefore, it should be set as ""Network"" (N).

2. Determine Attack Complexity (AC):
The description of the issue does not provide any detailed information on how the vulnerability exploits. However, given that cross-site scripting is often found in web applications, this may involve moderate skill and some experimentation to exploit.

3. Determine Privileges Required (PR):
Privileges required for this issue are none since it doesn't require privilege escalation or administrative access to run.

4. Determine User Interaction (UI):
The described vulnerability should be a remote and automated attack, which typically does not require user interaction. Therefore, set as ""None"" (N).

5. Determine Scope (S): 
As the description states that this issue affects the web application globally without specifying any local scope to it.

6. Determine Confidentiality (C):
The impact of this issue is on confidentiality since users could be tricked into revealing sensitive information or accessing unauthorized data through a malicious webpage. Therefore, set as ""High"" (H).

7. Determine Integrity (I): 
This vulnerability does affect the integrity of the system. When exploited, an attacker can modify the contents of web pages that have been read from the database.

8. Determine Availability (A):
The availability is low since this could be used in a denial-of-service attack or the target might block the requests to prevent unauthorized access and limit exposure.

CVE-2025-31091,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze it and map its components to the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector options.

The given CVE has a 'Stored XSS' vulnerability which suggests that an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages generated by CreativeMindsSolutions CM Header and Footer. The vector should be configured accordingly:

- AV: The attack vector is Network (N), as the vulnerability allows for remote exploitation.
- AC: The attack complexity is High (H) because it involves storing user-provided input in a server-side application, which could be exploited to execute malicious JavaScript code.
- PR: Privileges Required are None (N), since there's no indication that special privileges need to be escalated to exploit the vulnerability. This implies low privilege escalation risk, which matches with 'None' option in CVSS 3.1.
- UI: User Interaction is Required (R) because exploiting the vulnerability requires some level of user interaction, which could lead to storing malicious content on a webpage.
- S: Scope is Changed (C), indicating that the scope of the attack has changed from ""unchanged"" to something different - 'Changed' in this context denotes that the web application's behavior changes due to this vulnerability.
- C: Confidentiality remains High (H) since stored XSS can lead to unauthorized access and injection of malicious content into a user's session.
- I: Integrity is also High (H) because the attacker could potentially inject malicious code, altering the integrity of the data on the server-side application.
- A: Availability is Low (L), as the vulnerability might cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions if exploited.

CVE-2025-31092,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the provided CVE ID and description, we need to break down the information into its respective components.

Based on the given description of the vulnerability:

- Attack Vector (AV): The attack vector for this issue is Network (N), as it involves an external attacker launching the attack from a remote location.
- Attack Complexity (AC): Given that the proper implementation of web security measures should have prevented this cross-site scripting issue, we can categorize it as High (H) complexity. This indicates that exploiting this vulnerability requires significant skill and time but not necessarily advanced knowledge.
- Privileges Required (PR): Since there's no indication of requiring elevated privileges to launch an attack, the value is None (N).
- User Interaction (UI): It does not require user interaction (UI:N), as launching the attack remotely is sufficient.
- Scope (S): This vulnerability affects data stored on the server and potentially transmitted during interactions with users. Therefore, it should be considered as Changed (C).
- Confidentiality (C): The lack of proper protection for the web application makes user-sensitive data not adequately protected. Hence, confidentiality is impacted negatively, leading to a Low (L) classification.
- Integrity (I): Given that this issue involves cross-site scripting where an attacker could inject malicious scripts, integrity is affected negatively. However, since we are dealing with stored XSS and not a remote code execution vulnerability, it's Low but not High. Therefore, the classification for this would be Low (L).
- Availability (A): The described issue does not inherently impact availability negatively. There's no indication that an attacker could use this to prevent normal system operation entirely; however, if left unpatched or inadequately secured, it can lead to performance degradation and security issues over time.

CVE-2025-31095,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31095, we need to determine the values for each component based on the description provided.

Attack Vector (AV):
- Since the description mentions ""Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel"", it implies that the attack can be launched from a different location than the target, which corresponds to an Attack Vector of ""N"" (Network).

Attack Complexity (AC):
- Without explicit information about the steps required to exploit this vulnerability, we cannot directly determine AC. However, given the nature of an authentication bypass vulnerability, the complexity is likely low (""H"" for High is not typical for such vulnerabilities), so we will choose H as a reasonable assumption.

Privileges Required (PR):
- As it's an authentication bypass vulnerability without specifying any particular privileges escalation or requirements, we'll assume ""N"" (None).

User Interaction (UI):
- Authentication bypass typically does not require user interaction (""N"" for None).

Scope (S):
- Since the description specifically mentions that this issue affects Material Dashboard from version n/a through 1.4.5 and there's an alternate path or channel, we can reasonably assume that ""C"" (Changed) is applicable.

Confidentiality (C):
- As it involves authentication bypass which might potentially lead to exposure of data (especially if not properly secured), we'll choose a relatively high (""H"" for High).

Integrity (I):
- This also affects material dashboard, therefore likely compromised integrity (""L"" for Low).

Availability (A):
- Since it does not imply an unavailability of system resources but rather bypassing security controls, the availability aspect would be less impacted than confidentiality or integrity. Therefore, ""N"" is selected.

CVE-2025-31135,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31135, we need to analyze the provided CVE description and match it with the standard CVSS component options.

From the given CVE description:
- The vulnerability is an **Attack Vector** issue because a network attack can be used to exploit this issue.
- The **attack complexity** seems moderate since it does not involve complex manipulation of the system or exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities. It may require some interaction with the proxy server, but the client's ability to spoof its IP address indicates that the complexity is relatively low.

Given these observations:
- AV: Network
- AC: High

- The **Privileges Required** for this vulnerability seem to be Low as there isn't any information suggesting a need to elevate privileges beyond what's necessary for normal operation of the proxy server, although exploiting the issue does allow spoofing the IP address which might not require full control but could have implications for security. However, since it allows ""spoofing"" and that seems somewhat low in privilege requirements, I am opting for **Low**.
- UI: None 

- The vulnerability is related to the scope of how a client can manipulate an SMTP server's behavior by sending additional ""PROXY"" commands with data, changing the scope of the interaction. Therefore, this is **Changed (C)**.

Given these considerations:
- S: Changed
- C: High

- Confidentiality and integrity seem not to be directly affected but exploiting this vulnerability does allow a client to manipulate the communication in such a way that it could potentially lead to unauthorized access or data modification if not properly secured. Therefore, considering confidentiality **None** (N), for integrity we are choosing **High (H)** as there is significant impact on data integrity.
- I: High
- A: Low

Therefore, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31135 can be generated as follows:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L"

Given CVE-2025-31464 and its description:

- The vulnerability is a 'Cross-site Scripting' (XSS) issue.
- It's stored XSS (meaning the web application stores user-provided input without proper sanitization).
- This affects the `Text Selection Color` component from version 1.0 to 1.6.

Based on these details, we can determine:

- The Attack Vector is **Network** as this vulnerability would be exploited via a network connection.
- The Attack Complexity is **High** because manipulating such a script would require significant effort and knowledge of web application vulnerabilities.
- Privileges Required are **None** since the exploitation doesn't involve elevated privileges to the system or application running the vulnerable code.
- User Interaction is **Required** as the user must interact with the affected webpage to be exploited (by viewing the tainted content, for example).
- The Scope is **Changed** because the vulnerability affects only part of the application's functionality (`Text Selection Color`), changing its behavior without affecting other parts of the system.
- Confidentiality and Integrity are **Low** as this is primarily a control or presentation layer issue rather than affecting sensitive data or internal processes directly. Availability isn't applicable here since there's no mention of an impact on availability.

The provided CVE is related to a 'Cross-site Scripting' vulnerability, which falls under the category of S: Scope being Changed (C). However, in this case, it does not lead to unauthorized access or modification; instead, it results in Reflected XSS. This impacts the Availability aspect.

Therefore, based on the description provided:

- Attack Vector is Local (`AV:L`) since there's no indication that it would be used remotely.
- There isn't enough information about attack complexity that would categorize this as either High (`AC:H`) or Low (`AC:L`); however, given the nature of the vulnerability being a 'Cross-site Scripting' issue, we'll default to High (`AC:H`) for potential attacks, considering the severity and common vulnerabilities in such scenarios.
- Since there's no indication that special privileges are required beyond the normal functionality (`PR:N`), this remains None.
- The interaction between the user and the system isn't specified; however, most 'Cross-site Scripting' issues will not require direct user input, so we'll default to None for simplicity (`UI:N`).
- The vulnerability affects a component in the scope of `WP_Identicon`, which is part of WordPress. Therefore, the impact on Confidentiality and Integrity remains None (`C:N/I:N`). This is because such vulnerabilities primarily affect the system's availability rather than its ability to protect user data.
- Finally, given that this issue results in Reflected XSS, the Availability aspect is impacted. However, considering the context provided, this vulnerability doesn't necessarily lead to a denial of service or the inability to perform operations; thus, we default to Low (`A:L`) as an indicator of potential impact on availability.

AV: Attack Vector
AC: Attack Complexity
PR: Privileges Required
UI: User Interaction
S: Scope
C: Confidentiality
I: Integrity
A: Availability

Given the description of the vulnerability:
- It's a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- The attack leverages a format function not being schema-prefixed, which affects the affected users running outdated versions.

Based on this information:

- AV (Attack Vector) should be set to Adjacent (A), as it specifically mentions leveraging an existing configuration or setting in PostgreSQL databases without requiring network access directly. This is because the vulnerability doesn't necessitate any specific network connection but rather exploits an internal configuration of PostgreSQL that has already been configured by users.

- AC (Attack Complexity) is High (H), indicating a high level of complexity to exploit this vulnerability, as it involves leveraging an existing schema feature in a sophisticated way.

- PR (Privileges Required) should be set to High (H) since the vulnerability allows for elevation of privileges inside PostgreSQL databases.

- UI (User Interaction) is None (N), because while users need to have PostgreSQL installed and configured with this vulnerability, they typically do not directly interact with or modify the configuration settings themselves. The interaction happens through automated scripts or system-level configurations managed by administrators.

- S (Scope) is Unchanged (U), since this vulnerability does not change or affect any data outside of the PostgreSQL databases but specifically within those environments where aiven-extras is installed and running outdated versions.

- C (Confidentiality) should be set to High (H) because the vulnerability allows for an escalation in privileges that could lead to unauthorized access and modification of sensitive, confidential data stored in these databases.

- I (Integrity) is also High (H), as this vulnerability not only escalates privileges but can directly affect the integrity of database configurations, potentially leading to modifications or unauthorized data insertions.

- A (Availability) is set to Low (L) because while there's an impact on availability due to the potential for administrators needing to update to a newer version of aiven-extras and issue `ALTER EXTENSION` commands manually in each affected database, the immediate critical impact of this vulnerability seems to be more about data integrity and privilege escalation. However, considering the necessity for manual database adjustments and potentially impacting system uptime while those are performed, it leans towards Low.

AV: Attack Vector
Given that this vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit by modifying user data via a malicious macro on the XWiki server, which can be done remotely without needing any privileges or user interaction, it is classified as Adjacent (A). Therefore:


AC: Attack Complexity
The complexity of exploiting this vector seems moderate because it requires exploiting the JIRA macro and understanding its integration with XWiki. However, no detailed analysis was provided in the description to accurately categorize this within the standard CVSS 3.1 AC categories.


PR: Privileges Required
There are no specific privileges required for exploitation as it directly impacts user data by modifying wiki pages via a malicious JIRA macro. Therefore:


UI: User Interaction
Exploitation doesn't require any direct interaction with the user's input, but since the attacker could potentially modify or view sensitive information (like editing the user profile wiki page), this is classified as Required.


S: Scope
The scope of this vulnerability is Changed (C) because it affects data that can be accessed by users without necessarily needing access to other parts of the system. Also, exploiting this involves changing the behavior of XWiki and JIRA integration points.


C: Confidentiality
Since this affects editing user profile wiki pages, where sensitive information could potentially be visible or modified, it falls under High (H) confidentiality classification.


I: Integrity
Exploiting this vulnerability involves modifying wiki page content (possibly including sensitive data), which is a violation of system integrity. Therefore:


A: Availability
The attack doesn't affect the availability of the system but might cause issues if exploited for malicious intent. However, no critical impact on availability was explicitly mentioned in the description to classify it as Low or High.

Here's how we can break down the information:

- Attack Vector (AV): Since this is an exploitation of incorrectly configured access control security levels, it suggests that the attack requires human interaction to exploit, implying an Adjacent (A) vector.
- Attack Complexity (AC): This is a missing authorization vulnerability, suggesting Low (L) complexity because finding such vulnerabilities typically does not require advanced skills or techniques.
- Privileges Required (PR): Since this involves exploiting incorrectly configured access control security levels, no specific privileges are needed to exploit the issue. Therefore, No Privileges (N) should be assigned.
- User Interaction (UI): This is an exploitation vulnerability that requires user interaction to cause damage because it's related to security flaws in configuration settings. Therefore, None (N) interaction suggests a Remote attack vector but in this context, UI:R would indicate required interaction making it more like N since the impact seems to be solely on configuration.
- Scope (S): The vulnerability affects versions from n/a through 1.3.0, which means the scope is Unchanged (U).
- Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) depend on the specifics of the system affected but given the missing authorization aspect, we can conclude it's Confidentiality that could be impacted as Low (L).

CVE-2025-31545,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31545 based on its description, we first need to map its components against the standard criteria provided by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1.

Given:
- **AV**: Attack Vector: The attack vector is typically N for Network, but since it involves exploitation of a missing authorization vulnerability directly in an application without needing network connectivity or other external vectors, we'll consider A as the appropriate choice because this vector doesn't require any network connection to exploit.
  
- **AC**: Attack Complexity: The description mentions that this issue allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels. This implies a significant level of complexity due to the nature of the vulnerability itself and its potential impact, which typically corresponds with High (H) complexity.

- **PR**: Privileges Required: Since it's about missing authorization vulnerabilities in access control levels without specifying any particular privileges required beyond an initial configuration misstep, we can categorize this as None (N), indicating that exploiting this doesn't require elevated privileges to start the attack vector, though its effect could be significant if not properly configured.

- **UI**: User Interaction: The vulnerability does not directly impact user interaction because it's about configuration and access control levels. This typically corresponds with None (N) since no direct interaction is necessary for its exploitation.

- **S**: Scope: This vulnerability affects the Safe Ai Malware Protection for WP from n/a through 1.0.20, indicating a Changed (C) scope as it impacts specific versions or configurations of the software product affected.

- **C**: Confidentiality: Missing authorization vulnerabilities directly impact confidentiality by allowing unauthorized access to data or functions they're intended to protect. Therefore, this corresponds with High (H) confidentiality.

- **I**: Integrity: Since it's about missing authorization and not a modification or deletion issue, this typically doesn't affect integrity levels but can lead to the exploitation of data in some scenarios that were previously secured by incorrect configurations, suggesting Low (L) integrity.

- **A**: Availability: This vulnerability does not inherently cause unavailability but could impact availability if exploited due to its nature affecting access control. Thus, it leans more towards Low (L) availability as the immediate impact might be less severe than confidentiality or integrity issues in the long run.

Putting these components together:

```markdown
CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L

This CVSS 3.1 vector reflects that this vulnerability is primarily about exploiting an authorization configuration issue (A), which has a high level of attack complexity due to its potential for significant impact on data security (H). It does not require elevated privileges to start the exploit, doesn't interact directly with users, affects specific versions or configurations in terms of scope, impacts confidentiality significantly but integrity less so, and leads to low availability risk initially."

CVE Description: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in M. Tuhin Ultimate Push Notifications allows Reflected XSS. This issue affects Ultimate Push Notifications: from n/a through 1.1.8.

Based on the description, we can determine the following:

- **AV**: The attack vector is Adjacent (A), as it involves a reflected XSS vulnerability that is accessible without user interaction.
- **AC**: The attack complexity is High (H), since it requires an attacker to manipulate the input data to achieve the goal.
- **PR**: No specific privileges are required for this type of vulnerability, so we can set PR to None (N).
- **UI**: There is no user interaction involved in the exploitation of this vulnerability, making it UI:None (N).
- **S**: The scope of the attack is Changed (C), as it affects the data that is being processed.
- **C**: Confidentiality is High (H) because this vulnerability allows for the execution of malicious scripts on a server, which could lead to sensitive data exposure.

CVE-2025-3155,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-3155, we need to determine the values for each component based on the provided CVE description.

AV (Attack Vector) is Network (N), as it allows an attacker to access the target without local privilege escalation. The attack vector is not adjacent (A), physical (P), or low (L).

AC (Attack Complexity) is High (H), since this vulnerability requires a user to input and execute arbitrary scripts, which makes it relatively difficult.

PR (Privileges Required) is None (N), as the attacker does not need elevated privileges to exploit this issue.

UI (User Interaction) is Required (R), because the help document must be executed by an interactive user for the malicious script to run.

S (Scope) is Changed (C), since this vulnerability allows exfiltration of user files to an external environment, potentially exposing sensitive data.

C (Confidentiality) is High (H), as it involves the exposure of user files.

I (Integrity) is High (H), since the attacker's goal includes modifying user files and executing arbitrary scripts.

A (Availability) is Low (L), as a malicious user can still function while the system is compromised.

CVE-2025-31552,"To generate the correct CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze the description and assign scores based on the provided Vector Components.

Given information:
- **AV:** The vulnerability seems to be remotely exploitable over a network, but the lack of explicit ""Network"" or other vectors makes it difficult to determine this directly. However, based on common 'SQL Injection' vulnerabilities, we can reasonably assume a network vector is likely.
  
- **AC:** The complexity of SQL injection attacks depends on various factors such as how well an application handles user input and whether the error handling mechanisms are secure. Without explicit details about the RSVPMarker's security practices or the severity of this specific issue, assigning AC requires some inference. However, assuming a more complex attack that involves manipulating database queries to inject malicious SQL code, AC could be moderate (H) rather than low.

- **PR:** This vulnerability does not require any privileges beyond those typically available to an attacker without authentication, so PR is likely None (N).

- **UI:** There's no indication that user interaction is required for this attack. Thus, UI remains None (N).

- **S:** The scope of the issue seems limited to the RSVPMarker application and its database rather than broader systems. Therefore, S is Unchanged (U) unless there's specific evidence indicating otherwise.

- **C:** SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data stored in databases. Given that this vulnerability specifically targets an application's handling of user input to inject malicious SQL code, Confidentiality (C) seems High (H).

- **I:** An attacker could modify database records without authorization if they exploit this SQL Injection flaw successfully. This suggests Integrity (I) is compromised for the affected records.

- **A:** The availability of the RSVPMarker application or its critical functions isn't directly impacted by SQL injection; however, successful exploitation might prevent certain functionalities temporarily until patched. Therefore, Availability (A) is considered None (N), indicating no impact on service availability due to this specific vulnerability vector.

Based on these considerations and given the lack of explicit information that would suggest otherwise, a reasonable CVSS 3.1 vector for this CVE could be:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"
CVE-2025-31553,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to map the provided description to the corresponding vulnerability components.

The CVE description mentions a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IDX Broker IMPress. This indicates that:

- The attack vector is Adjacent (A), as the issue affects the same system or network as the user.
- The attack complexity is Low (L), since it only involves proper input validation and does not require any complex actions.
- No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, so we use None (N).
- There's no user interaction involved in exploiting this flaw, indicating UI:None (N).
- Since the vulnerability only affects web pages generated by the application, it primarily impacts confidentiality, making S:Changed (C) appropriate.
- The impact on confidentiality is Low (L), as the XSS exploit won't steal sensitive data but could be used for other malicious purposes.
- Integrity of data isn't directly impacted by this vulnerability, so we use None (N).
- Finally, the availability of the application might not be directly affected in terms of being down or unavailable due to this specific XSS issue, leading us to None (N).

CVE-2025-31572,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE description, we first need to identify the vector components based on the description and then fill in the corresponding values from the given list.

From the CVE description, we can infer:

- AV: Attack Vector is Adjacent (A) because it's a cross-site request forgery issue which likely doesn't require physical access but rather relies on user interaction with the web application.
- AC: Attack Complexity is High (H) due to the nature of Cross-Site Request Forgery, which can be complex in its implementation and execution without proper security measures.
- PR: Privileges Required is None (N), as CSRF doesn't inherently require elevated privileges to execute.
- UI: User Interaction is Required (R), because it's a web-based vulnerability that relies on user actions or data to exploit the system.
- S: Scope is Changed (C) since it affects the functionality and operation of the multi days events and multi events in one day calendar feature.
- C: Confidentiality is Low (L) as this issue seems to impact more about the availability of features rather than sensitive confidential information.
- I: Integrity is High (H), because if exploited, a malicious request can alter or delete data within the application's scope without being easily detected by standard security checks.
- A: Availability is High (H), since an attack like CSRF could lead to unavailability of services offered by the system.

So the CVSS vector for the given CVE ID would be:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI=R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H"

CVE-2025-31574,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE ID and description, we can break down the information as per the standard CVSS scoring system.


Given Information:
- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-31574
- **Description:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in SoftHopper Custom Content Scrollbar allows Stored XSS. This issue affects Custom Content Scrollbar: from n/a through 1.3.

Analyzing the given information and applying it to the standard CVSS scoring system:

- **AV (Attack Vector):** As per the description, an attacker may exploit this remotely.
- **AC (Attack Complexity):** The attack complexity isn't specified in detail, but since we know that the issue affects Custom Content Scrollbar from a certain version through 1.3 and it is not clear how difficult the exploitation would be, we have to make an assumption here based on the impact and the lack of detailed information about complexity.
- **PR (Privileges Required):** There is no indication of whether privileges are required or not, so it's best to select 'None' since there isn't enough data to determine otherwise.
- **UI (User Interaction):** The attack may be launched without user interaction as it can lead to Stored XSS vulnerabilities, which often exploit vulnerabilities in server-side code rather than requiring a user input.
- **S (Scope):** Since the vulnerability is specifically affecting Custom Content Scrollbar and we know that the issue starts from a certain version up to 1.3, this would typically suggest 'Unchanged' unless further details provided by the CVE's description give us an understanding of how it affects other components or systems beyond just 'Custom Content Scrollbar'. However, given only the specified impact on Custom Content Scrollbar without any mention of it affecting other parts of the system, we'll choose 'Unchanged'.
- **C (Confidentiality):** This is a Stored XSS vulnerability, which implies that the confidentiality of data isn't the primary concern here but rather the potential for scripts to be executed.
- **I (Integrity):** Similar to confidentiality concerns because once an XSS attack occurs, it doesn't matter whether the user can see sensitive data - their view is compromised, and an attack was successful in this context.
- **A (Availability):** The vulnerability could cause the application or service affected by SoftHopper Custom Content Scrollbar to be unavailable due to its exploitation. However, we don't have explicit information about system unavailability following the successful execution of XSS attacks against this particular component.

With these considerations and without further detailed information from the CVE description that could alter our interpretation:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N"

CVE-2025-31591,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the provided CVE description, I'll analyze it according to the given guidelines and apply them to the respective components.

- **AV (Attack Vector)**: Adjacent (A) is indicated since an attacker does not need to deploy any agents on a target system. The attackers can exploit this over network shares or other nearby systems that are connected directly by a physical connection.
  
- **AC (Attack Complexity)**: Low (L) is provided as the complexity seems to involve straightforward manipulation to exploit an already vulnerable program.

- **PR (Privileges Required)**: None (N) since no special privileges, such as root access or member of a specific group, are needed for exploitation.

- **UI (User Interaction)**: Required (R) indicates that the attacker must interact with the system in some way. This could be user input, network request, etc., to execute the vulnerability.

- **S (Scope)**: Unchanged (U) seems appropriate as there isn't any information given about how this exploit works across different systems or environments. If it's a server-side issue, it remains unchanged for all users; if client-side, it affects user sessions on a per-session basis.

- **C (Confidentiality)**: High (H) is indicated since the vulnerability involves stored XSS. This could potentially expose sensitive data that the website does not intentionally want to make visible.

- **I (Integrity)**: High (H) follows from C, as XSS vulnerabilities can also allow attackers to modify content on a web page in ways they shouldn't be able to, which affects data integrity.

- **A (Availability)**: None (N) is the right answer here since a successful exploit for this could result in a denial of service but doesn't necessarily impact availability directly. The system remains available until it's downed by an attacker.

CVE-2025-31595,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE, we need to break down the description and apply the relevant criteria from the CVSS 3.1 specification.

From the description, we can identify:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Adjacent (A) because the vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the issue without needing direct access to the system.
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) since the exploitation of this issue likely requires minimal expertise and effort compared to other types of vulnerabilities.
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) as no special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) because, although it could be triggered through user action, the attack vector is adjacent, suggesting the issue doesn't require direct user interaction beyond that.
- **Scope (S):** Changed (C) due to the nature of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities affecting data presentation and security on a web page.
- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) because this vulnerability affects the confidentiality of sensitive data when it is exposed through XSS, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions by attackers.
- **Integrity (I):** High (H) as the integrity of user data is compromised due to the potential to manipulate and execute malicious scripts on users' browsers.
- **Availability (A):** None (N) because while this vulnerability primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it does not directly impact availability. However, attacks exploiting this might indirectly lead to resource consumption or system overload, but such impact would be more about the nature of XSS itself rather than a direct denial-of-service scenario typically described by the AV:Adjacency.

Based on the provided information:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Given that the vulnerability allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels, it can be inferred that this is an **Adjacent (A)** attack vector.
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** The description mentions a ""Missing Authorization"" issue, which indicates a relatively low complexity level. Thus, this would likely be classified as **High (H).**
- **Privileges Required (PR):** There's no information in the CVE description regarding specific privileges required for exploitation. However, based on common vulnerability categorizations and considering it doesn't require elevated privileges to exploit, we can infer that **None (N)** is appropriate.
- **User Interaction (UI):** The vulnerability allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels without requiring any user interaction, indicating a **None (N) UI.**
- **Scope (S):** Since the issue does not affect all configurations or versions of the software and specifically affects CF7 Spreadsheets from n/a through 2.3.2, we can classify this as a Changed (C) scope.
- **Confidentiality (C):** Given that this vulnerability involves authorization issues, which are related to access control and security levels, it can be inferred that confidentiality is impacted, making it likely classified as Low (L). 
- **Integrity (I):** There's no information in the CVE description suggesting that data integrity would be directly affected by this exploit. Thus, we infer that this would also be Low (L).
- **Availability (A):** The fact that this issue affects a missing authorization level and does not inherently require or result in the unavailability of system services makes availability less likely to be impacted. Therefore, it might be classified as None (N).

Given these inferences, we can generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31603:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning for each component:

- AV: Network (N) - The attack vector is network-based, which means it can be launched remotely without needing to physically access the system.
- AC: High (H) - The attack complexity is high because it requires exploiting incorrectly configured access control security levels in the software.
- PR: None (N) - No specific privileges are required for this vulnerability, meaning an attacker could potentially exploit the issue regardless of their privileges on the system.
- UI: None (N) - This is a server-side vulnerability that doesn't require user interaction to be exploited; it relies purely on exploiting a configuration misstep in the software.
- S: Changed (C) - The scope affected by this vulnerability includes the SP Blog Designer application, indicating that changes made to the software's security settings can impact its functionality or behavior.
- C: Low (L) - Although not ideal from a security perspective, the confidentiality of data is somewhat protected by the software's authorization mechanisms being correctly configured. However, the presence of a missing authorization mechanism makes this classification necessary in the context of CVSS 3.1.
- I: Low (L) - Integrity is somewhat maintained because of proper configuration; however, an attacker with sufficient privileges could still alter data or functionality that would otherwise be secure due to correct access control settings.
- A: None (N) - The availability of the system is not impacted by this vulnerability, as it primarily deals with authorization rather than the general capabilities of the software."
CVE-2025-31607,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze the vulnerability description and match it with the corresponding vector components.

Based on the provided information:

- **AV**: The attack vector is **Network (N)**, as there's no indication of a local or physical attack.

- **AC**: The attack complexity is **High (H)**, because the flaw in this case allows an attacker to inject malicious code into web pages generated by Simple-Audioplayer.

- **PR**: There are **No Privileges Required (N)**, since the vulnerability does not require any specific privileges.

- **UI**: There's no user interaction involved, hence **None (N)**.

- **S**: The scope is **Changed (C)**, because a maliciously constructed web page can cause harm by injecting malicious code into users' browsers.

- **C**: This is a vulnerability affecting confidentiality. Therefore, it has an impact on the confidentiality of data and should be rated as **High (H)**.

- **I**: The integrity of the system is not affected directly in this scenario; therefore, no change from the original state occurs.

- **A**: The availability of the system remains unaffected, hence a rating of **None (N)**.

Therefore, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31607 should be:

- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) because Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks require social engineering tactics and are often hard to defend against.
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) since a successful attack does not need any additional privileges to execute beyond what the application already has.
- User Interaction (UI): None (N) as most CSRF attacks don't interact directly with the user but rather take advantage of their actions within the context of the application.
- Scope (S): Changed (C) because the vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform unintended actions that were previously restricted, thereby altering the behavior or state of the system.
- Confidentiality (C): None (N) as CSRF attacks typically don't aim for confidentiality but rather for functionality or privilege escalation.
- Integrity (I): Low (L) because while integrity is affected in terms of security posture, the immediate and direct impact on data content is not significant unless the action taken by an attacker has a direct impact on data integrity, which isn't typically the primary goal of CSRF attacks.
- Availability (A): High (H) as the primary effect of a successful attack usually doesn’t involve making services or systems less available.

CVE-2025-31622,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we can analyze the description and apply the corresponding CVSS 3.1 metrics:

- **AV (Attack Vector):** Given that this issue is a Stored XSS vulnerability in an application, it's reasonable to assume it is an **Adjacency (A)** attack vector as an attacker would need physical access to the system or some other form of adjacent access.

- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Since the vulnerability involves storing user-provided data without proper sanitization or escaping, the complexity might be moderate but given the impact, let's assume **Medium (M)** complexity. However, CVSS 3.1 doesn't explicitly use 'M' as an option; instead, it uses a scale from Low (L) to High (H). For simplicity and based on typical descriptions for similar vulnerabilities, we will choose **High (H)**, acknowledging that the attack's feasibility is relatively high given the scenario.

- **PR (Privileges Required):** Since this is a Stored XSS vulnerability affecting user data without any further requirements such as privileges escalation to execute malicious scripts directly, it suggests no additional privileges are required. So, we have **None (N)**.

- **UI (User Interaction):** This is a web application vulnerability that does not require any user interaction once the initial request is made by the attacker, which aligns with **None (N)**.

- **S (Scope):** Stored XSS vulnerabilities can affect data within the same origin without changing it. However, for simplicity and considering this could be an issue affecting user data in a web application, let's assume a **Unchanged (U)** scope.

- **C (Confidentiality):** Cross-site scripting is primarily about injecting malicious scripts into otherwise trusted content, which impacts the confidentiality of that content. Therefore, we have **High (H) Confidentiality Impact**.

- **I (Integrity):** Similar to Confidentiality, as an XSS vulnerability can lead to injection of user-provided code or scripts in a web page without proper validation, affecting its integrity, we select **High (H) Integrity Impact**.

- **A (Availability):** There is no clear indication that this vulnerability directly affects the availability of resources. Therefore, we have **None (N)** as the Availability impact.

Considering these points, the generated CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31622 would be:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Explanation:
- AV: Attack Vector is Network (N) because the attack targets a network resource.
- AC: Attack Complexity is High (H) because it involves manipulating input to achieve the desired outcome, which can be challenging.
- PR: Privileges Required is None (N), as no specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- UI: User Interaction is None (N), since it does not require user interaction to execute the attack.
- S: Scope is Changed (C) because the vulnerability's impact changes depending on the system affected.
- C: Confidentiality is Low (L) because, although the vulnerability involves a stored XSS attack, the impact primarily affects confidentiality by allowing attackers to potentially inject malicious content.
- I: Integrity is Low (L), as the primary goal of the attack is not necessarily to prevent modifications but rather to exploit and take advantage of an existing vulnerability.
- A: Availability is None (N) because the presence of the vulnerability does not inherently cause the system to become unavailable."

- **AV:** The attack vector indicates how an attacker can access the affected component. Given that this is a web application vulnerability affecting stored XSS, the most appropriate value for AV would be 'A', indicating ""Adjacent"". 
- **AC:** The attack complexity refers to how difficult it is to exploit the vulnerability. Since this issue involves storing and executing user-supplied input, which can potentially lead to a high level of complexity, the value should be 'H' for High.
- **PR:** There's no indication in the CVE that privileges are required to exploit this issue. So, we'll use 'N', indicating ""None"".
- **UI:** The interaction required by an attacker is also not explicitly stated as any sort of user input. Hence, the value will be 'N' for ""None"".
- **S:** This section relates to the scope of the vulnerability, whether it's changed or remains unchanged. Since this issue affects stored XSS in a web application, the most relevant choice would be 'C', indicating ""Changed.""
- **C:** Given that this is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which impacts confidentiality by allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website, we use 'H' for High.
- **I:** The integrity of data isn't affected here. Instead, it's more about confidentiality and potential availability, so we'll choose ""N"" for No.

CVE-2025-31780,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE ID and description, I'll break down the components based on the provided information.

- **AV (Attack Vector):** The CVE description mentions that this issue is remotely exploitable, which aligns with an ""Attack Vector of Network"" or ""N"".

- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Given the nature of authorization vulnerabilities often being relatively straightforward to exploit, I'd categorize it as ""Low"" or ""L"".

- **PR (Privileges Required):** Since this vulnerability involves missing authorization and exploits incorrectly configured access control security levels, it implies that the attacker wouldn't need any special privileges to exploit it, which aligns with ""None"" or ""N"".

- **UI (User Interaction):** This is a remotely exploitable issue without needing user interaction, so it's categorized as ""None"" or ""N"".

- **S (Scope):** The issue primarily affects the server-side functionality of the ""Append Content"" feature within certain versions (from n/a through 2.1.1), indicating a change in scope related to data processing and security. This suggests ""Changed"" or ""C"".

- **C (Confidentiality):** Given that this is an authorization vulnerability, the focus here would be on confidentiality implications, which are typically high due to the nature of accessing sensitive information without proper authorization.

- **I (Integrity):** Similar to Confidentiality, since this involves missing authorization, integrity of data could also be compromised when access control levels are incorrectly configured. Therefore, it's categorized as ""High"" or ""H"".

- **A (Availability):** The exploitation of this issue would indeed affect availability since the server might not be able to function correctly due to unauthorized access, thus leading to high impact on availability.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-31791,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for a given CVE description, we need to identify and categorize its characteristics based on the standard components outlined in the problem statement. Here’s how we can approach it with the provided example:

Given CVE:
- `CVE ID: CVE-2025-31791`
- `CVE Description`: Missing Authorization vulnerability in Oliver Boyers Pin Generator allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels. This issue affects Pin Generator: from n/a through 2.0.0.

For this description, we can categorize its characteristics as follows:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** Since the vulnerability is specifically related to an authorization flaw in a product or service, and given that it’s not clear if it would be exploitable remotely without access or through a network, we'll choose **N** for Network. This option indicates that at least one of these types of attacks can exploit a vulnerability.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** Given the description implies a level of sophistication in understanding and exploiting this authorization flaw, which is not trivial but might be moderately complex to exploit without proper knowledge or tools, we choose **H** for High complexity. This acknowledges that exploiting such a flaw would require some skill or specific tools.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):** The description does not directly imply the need for elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability, as it's about authorization being exploited through configuration rather than access rights escalation. Thus, we select **N**, indicating no privileges are required to exploit.

4. **User Interaction (UI):** Since this is a server-side issue related to an incorrectly configured security feature of software that presumably does not interact directly with users in its normal operation, the interaction would be none or minimal. Therefore, we choose **N** for None.

5. **Scope (S):** This vulnerability affects how authorization levels are managed within the Pin Generator functionality across a range of versions from n/a to 2.0.0. However, it does not fundamentally alter the behavior in terms of data exposure or access without some form of exploitation. Thus, we select **C**, indicating that the scope is Changed.

6. **Confidentiality (C):** The vulnerability impacts authorization levels which are critical for user identity and privacy within the software's context. Therefore, we choose **H** for High confidentiality impact.

7. **Integrity (I):** This issue does not affect data integrity but rather how access to authorized data is managed through incorrect configuration of security levels in Pin Generator software. So, we select **N**, indicating no impact on data integrity.

8. **Availability (A):** The vulnerability, if exploited correctly under the described conditions and without immediate patches applied, could cause a denial of service to authorized users due to authorization issues. Therefore, we choose **L** for Low availability, as it is plausible this could be a service disruption that could occur if an attacker exploits correctly.

With these characteristics identified:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L"
CVE-2025-31792,"Based on the provided information and the standard CVSS 3.1 vector format, I would generate the following CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31792:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-31793,"Based on the provided information, I will extract and generate the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE.

The description mentions ""Cross-site Scripting"" vulnerability which implies a potential impact on Confidentiality (C). The description also mentions ""Stored XSS"", which suggests User Interaction (UI) is required but the user does not need elevated privileges, thus indicating that no Privileges Required (PR).

However, without specific details about scope (S), attack vector (AV), and availability (A), I will default to general assumptions.

Here's my attempt at generating the CVSS 3.1 vector:

CVE-2025-31796,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to follow the CVSS 3.1 scoring guidelines and assign scores based on the provided information.

1. Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - The vulnerability is exploited over a network, which indicates an attack vector of N.
2. Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) - The severity of the vulnerability suggests that it's a complex one to exploit, indicating AC:H.
3. Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - This vulnerability does not require any specific privileges to be exploited.
4. User Interaction (UI): None (N) - There is no user interaction required for this attack vector, as it occurs automatically when exploiting the vulnerability.
5. Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - The nature of the vulnerability suggests that its scope remains unchanged, even in a successful exploitation scenario.
6. Confidentiality (C): Low (L) - Since this is a server-side request forgery issue, confidentiality isn't directly impacted; hence it's L.
7. Integrity (I): High (H) - Intentionally manipulating the request could alter data integrity, leading to potential security issues.
8. Availability (A): None (N) - While an attack might temporarily affect availability, the primary concern is with data integrity.

Putting these values into the CVSS 3.1 format gives us:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"
CVE-2025-31797,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31797, I'll break down its components based on the provided description:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** High (H) - The attack requires significant resources and expertise to exploit.
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) - The attacker does not need any privileges to execute the attack.
- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) - The attack can be executed without user interaction.
- **Scope (S):** Changed (C) - The scope of this vulnerability is that it affects Sprout Clients, which changes when updated.
- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) - This vulnerability affects confidentiality by allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Integrity (I):** Low (L) - Although a high severity, this attack does not affect data integrity directly.
- **Availability (A):** None (N) - The attack does not cause denial-of-service but could potentially impact availability through subsequent attacks.

Therefore, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31797 is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-31798,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE ID and description, I will analyze the description to determine the appropriate values for each component of the vector.

- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent (A) is not listed in your provided data but we can infer that based on ""This issue affects Publitio: from n/a through 2.1.8"" it seems that this is a local vulnerability since it's describing an impact within the same system, so AV = A.
- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) is listed in your provided data and since we can infer that ""Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels"" might require some level of technical expertise to exploit, AC = H.
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) seems like the most appropriate value given that no specific privileges are required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.
- User Interaction (UI): None (N) is listed in your provided data as well since there's no indication of any user interaction being needed.
- Scope (S): Changed (C) appears to be a valid option here because the issue seems to affect the security level of Publitio, which would result in a changed scope. However, this can be debatable depending on interpretation.
- Confidentiality (C): High (H) can be inferred from the description ""Missing Authorization vulnerability"" as exploiting such a vulnerability could potentially allow unauthorized access or information disclosure.
- Integrity (I): High (H) seems to be a valid option here since there's no indication of whether data is being modified during this issue; the focus appears on authorization levels which are crucial for maintaining data integrity. However, the same level of interpretation as confidentiality applies.
- Availability (A): Low (L) might seem like an initial guess, but it can be argued that while this may not have a direct availability impact at first glance due to not affecting service uptime per se, ""Missing Authorization"" in its nature may introduce additional risks if exploited. However, the description doesn't explicitly state that it affects availability directly.

CVE-2025-31889,"To generate the correct CVSS Vector for the given CVE, we'll analyze the description and apply the corresponding CVSS 3.1 values.

- The description mentions ""Cross-site Scripting"", which indicates an Attack Vector of `A` (Adjacent). This is because Cross-site Scripting typically involves attacks on a web application from the same origin or adjacent location.
  
- It mentions no specific complexity for implementation or exploitation, suggesting it's more straightforward than average. Therefore, we use `AC:L` for Attack Complexity.

- Since there are no indications of any privileges being required to exploit this vulnerability, `PR:N` is selected as Privileges Required (None).

- There's no user interaction described in the vulnerability context, leading us to choose `UI:N`.

- The impact on confidentiality does not seem significant here; hence, we pick `C:N`.

- The attack vector does not specify a change or unaffected scope. Given the nature of Cross-site Scripting as an adjacent issue within a web application, it's most reasonable to select `S:C` for Changed.

- Integrity seems to be affected since this is a script injection vulnerability. Therefore, we choose `I:L`.

- Lastly, since there's no mention about availability being impacted or otherwise related directly in the description, we go with the default `A:N` option, assuming it remains unaffected.


So, applying these values:

CVE-2025-31896,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-31896 based on your detailed breakdown, we'll consider each component according to the given description:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** The vulnerability is described as an ""Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels,"" which typically implies that there's a configuration issue rather than a direct remote attack vector. However, since it allows exploiting and affects local access, we will consider this scenario locally exploitable.
  - AV: Local (L)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** The description of the vulnerability being an ""Missing Authorization"" suggests complexity beyond basic exploitation but does not clearly indicate how much complexity there is beyond just identifying and exploiting a missing authorization step. Therefore, given that it directly affects incorrectly configured access levels which could be exploitable without extensive setup or resources required, we'll consider this to have moderate attack complexity.
  - AC: High (H)

- **Privileges Required (PR):** The vulnerability allows exploiting the issue with ""Missing Authorization,"" suggesting no special privileges are needed for exploitation since it's more about what was already allowed rather than additional permissions. Thus, there's a need for none or low privilege for an attacker to exploit this issue.
  - PR: None (N)

- **User Interaction (UI):** The vulnerability allows exploitation without user interaction required. An attacker could potentially exploit the issue without the user being involved in the process at all, making it a non-interaction scenario.
  - UI: None (N)

- **Scope (S):** Given that this is about exploiting an authorization issue within a software component affecting local access, we consider that the scope doesn't change significantly unless specific configurations are altered that could introduce changes to what's considered normal operation. Hence, it remains unchanged for the basic exploitation scenario described.
  - S: Unchanged (U)

- **Confidentiality (C):** The vulnerability is related to missing authorization in a plugin, which generally affects data access levels. This typically leads to Confidentiality being impacted.
  - C: High (H)

- **Integrity (I):** Since the issue involves exploitation of an authorization mechanism that doesn't inherently protect against modification or alteration of data (which could be considered integrity issues), and it's described as missing rather than present, we consider the impact on Integrity to be low. However, given the nature of the vulnerability being about authorization levels, there might not be a direct implication for data integrity in this context.
  - I: Low (L)

- **Availability (A):** The issue primarily impacts access control which can indirectly affect availability by making it harder or impossible for users to perform actions due to incorrect access configurations. Thus, the vulnerability has an impact on Availability.
  - A: High (H)

Therefore, combining all these considerations into a CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31896 gives us:

CVE-2025-31900,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the provided CVE ID and description, I'll break down the information into its corresponding components:

- **AV**: Attack Vector - As described in the problem, this issue is a Reflected XSS vulnerability which typically occurs through user interaction, making it adjacent or local to the target system.

- **AC**: Attack Complexity - Given that the vulnerability involves manipulating an input (the web page content itself) to cause Cross-site Scripting without any additional steps required beyond accessing the affected webpage, I would categorize this as having a low attack complexity.

- **PR**: Privileges Required - The described issue doesn't require elevated privileges to exploit; thus, it falls under ""None"" for privileges required.

- **UI**: User Interaction - Since the vulnerability is exploited by accessing an affected webpage (with no special setup beyond that), it requires user interaction, marking this as ""Required"".

- **S**: Scope - This is a Reflected XSS which affects only the data received from the client through the web service. Thus, the scope is ""Unchanged"" for the purposes of this vulnerability.

- **C**: Confidentiality - Given it's primarily about preventing malicious scripts being injected into otherwise trusted content, this could be considered as affecting confidentiality, but with a relatively low impact (since it's just Cross-site Scripting and not sensitive data being leaked).

- **I**: Integrity - This is also impacted due to the risk of executing arbitrary JavaScript on a user's browser, which compromises their system integrity.

- **A**: Availability - The nature of this vulnerability doesn't inherently lead to the reduction or loss of service availability in the way that an attacker could cause it directly. 

Therefore, based on these considerations:

CVE-2025-31911,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE ID and description, I'll break down the attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, scope, confidentiality, integrity, and availability components based on the information given.

Given:
- **AV**: The attack vector is Adjacent (A).
- **AC**: The attack complexity is High (H) due to the nature of SQL Injection vulnerabilities being challenging to identify without extensive knowledge or access to internal workings.
- **PR**: No privileges are required for the exploitation, as the issue allows for remote execution with minimal rights to perform a blind SQL injection, which suggests it's possible to execute attacks against systems that don't require elevated permissions. Thus, Privileges Required is None (N).
- **UI**: Since this vulnerability allows for potential blind SQL injection without requiring user interaction other than possibly triggering the exploit in the background or through automated means, User Interaction can be considered as None (N).
- **S**: This vulnerability primarily affects confidentiality and integrity by allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data. However, it does not change the existing state of a system in terms of scope but does so without changing the information in some way that would indicate a successful exploit in a manner easily detectable by users. Thus, the Scope is Unchanged (U).
- **C**: The vulnerability significantly impacts confidentiality since it allows unauthorized access to data. Therefore, Confidentiality is High (H).
- **I**: This vulnerability also impacts integrity as the exploitation can result in unauthorized modification of sensitive or critical system components. Therefore, Integrity is High (H) as well.
- **A**: Since this issue allows for potential disruption of service without completely taking down a system and with the understanding that the severity lies more in data exposure rather than system availability, the Availability remains Low (L).

Therefore, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-31911 based on the provided description is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"
CVE-2025-3192,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the specified CVE, we must first identify the corresponding attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, scope, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** Given that a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was discovered in the `setUrl()` function due to missing input restriction and this would allow an attacker access localhost and list its directories, it is an attack vector of **Network (N)**.
2.  **Attack Complexity (AC):** The description mentions that the issue is due to a missing restriction on user input in the `setUrl()` function. This implies a certain complexity. A missing restriction on user input falls into the category of **High (H) Attack Complexity** since it requires some technical expertise from an attacker to exploit.
3.  **Privileges Required (PR):** There is no information provided about whether the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or obtain sensitive data, all of which would require certain privileges. Hence, this remains as **None (N) Privileges Required**.
4.  **User Interaction (UI):** The description states that attackers could list all of its directories by accessing localhost, implying that there is no user interaction required for the vulnerability. Therefore, it's **None (N) User Interaction**.
5.  **Scope (S):** Given that this vulnerability can be exploited on a network without requiring access to local resources and only allows for read operations at the localhost level, we categorize it as **Unchanged (U) Scope**.
6.  **Confidentiality (C):** Since the specific data being accessed on localhost isn't mentioned, we default to the lowest level of confidentiality, which is **None (N)** in this context.
7.  **Integrity (I):** There's no mention that an attacker can modify data, so it remains as **None (N) Integrity**.
8.  **Availability (A):** The fact that an attacker can only access localhost means the system's availability isn't affected by this vulnerability, and thus we categorize it as **None (N)** Availability.

Based on these steps, the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector is:

```bash
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N
```

This indicates that this vulnerability has a moderate attack vector, high complexity of attack required to exploit it, no special privileges are needed, there is no user interaction, the system scope remains unchanged due to this vulnerability not affecting availability or access on other systems, there's no confidentiality impact, integrity isn't affected, and finally, availability isn't impacted."
CVE-2025-3194,"Based on the provided CVE description, I will generate the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-3197,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we will break down the vulnerability description and map it to the corresponding CVSS 3.1 components:

- **AV**: Attack Vector
  - The vulnerability can be launched from an adjacent network or local system.
  - Since the attack is not remote but rather requires access to a specific configuration file, **AV:N** (Network) seems appropriate.

- **AC**: Attack Complexity
  - Exploiting this vulnerability would require low skill and knowledge due to its nature of being related to object literal syntax injection, which allows a user to inject arbitrary data into the prototype chain.
  - Thus, the attack complexity is categorized as **H** (High).

- **PR**: Privileges Required
  - The function `expand()` does not check the keys of an object before setting a nested property. This means that a user could potentially inject malicious data without needing elevated privileges.
  - Therefore, this vulnerability would require **N** (None) privileges.

- **UI**: User Interaction
  - Exploiting this vulnerability typically requires no interaction with the affected user as it involves manipulating a library's internal state to inject arbitrary data.
  - The attack is initiated automatically by exploiting a vulnerable version of the library.
  - Thus, the interaction level for this vector is **N** (None).

- **S**: Scope
  - The vulnerability primarily affects data in memory or on disk that can be manipulated directly or indirectly through functions like `expand()`.
  - Therefore, the impact on confidentiality is classified as **C:N**.

- **C**: Confidentiality
  - Since the primary focus here is on arbitrary code injection without necessarily revealing sensitive information to unauthorized parties, we consider this a **N** (None) risk.

- **I**: Integrity
  - This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate data that can potentially lead to integrity loss by adding or modifying existing data.
  - Hence, it's categorized as **L** (Low).

- **A**: Availability
  - While the primary concern is about potential code injection for malicious purposes, this type of attack would be classified as a low availability threat since the system could still continue to function with minimal impact upon exploitation.

Based on the above breakdown, the CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-3197 can be generated as follows:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L
```"
CVE-2025-32049,"To generate the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-32049, we need to follow the provided Vector Components:

- AV: Attack Vector [Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P)]
- AC: Attack Complexity [Low (L), High (H)]
- PR: Privileges Required [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
- UI: User Interaction [None (N), Required (R)]
- S: Scope [Unchanged (U), Changed (C)]
- C: Confidentiality [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
- I: Integrity [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]
- A: Availability [None (N), Low (L), High (H)]

Based on the CVE description, we can determine that:

- AV: Network because libsoup is a networking component.
- AC: High because accepting large WebSocket messages can lead to denial of service and significant resource allocation, which requires considerable planning and exploitation skills.
- PR: None because it only affects the server-side (libsoup) without requiring any privileges on the local system.
- UI: None because it does not require user interaction; it is a passive vulnerability.
- S: Changed because it affects the scope of libsoup by potentially leading to denial of service when accepting large WebSocket messages.
- C: Low because this is a partial confidentiality vulnerability since only the server-side and possibly other connected clients are directly affected, but the data being processed is not sensitive in most cases.
- I: None because, although denial-of-service might be considered an integrity issue, it's specifically due to resource exhaustion rather than actual modification of data.
- A: High because acceptance of a large WebSocket message could lead to denial of service (DoS), which would significantly impact the server availability.

Therefore, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-32049 is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:H"
CVE-2025-32050,"Based on the provided information and CVE description, I would classify the vulnerability as follows:

CVE-2025-32052,"Based on the CVE description, I would generate the following CVSS vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-32053,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to identify its components based on the provided description and then fill in the corresponding values according to the CVSS 3.1 guidelines.

The description indicates a heap buffer over-read vulnerability in the `sniff_feed_or_html()` and `skip_insignificant_space()` functions of libsoup. This situation aligns with an Attack Vector of **A** (Adjacent), as the attack can be launched from the same system or process, implying that the attacker could potentially exploit this without needing to transport data across a network.

The description suggests that privileges are not escalated and does not require user interaction, which matches with **AV:** being **N** for Network. The manipulation of input leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) situation where no further information is provided on possible remote exploitation or whether the vulnerability could be used without user interaction. This means we can categorize it under **UI: N**, indicating no User Interaction required.

For Scope, this scenario affects ""Unchanged"" components within the system since the heap buffer over-read vulnerability seems to primarily impact internal library functionality rather than data exchanged between different systems or processes. Thus, it falls under **S:** being **U** for Unchanged.

The nature of the issue involves confidentiality risks due to the manipulation of data leading to a potential exposure in memory space. This implies that confidentiality is affected and should be classified under **C:** with a value of **H**, indicating High risk.

Lastly, integrity refers to the reliability or correctness of data stored within systems. The described vulnerability does not directly impact data's integrity but rather its representation within memory spaces, thus **I:** would also be considered as having High (H) risks due to potential memory corruption and related issues.

Putting all these pieces together, we get:

CVE-2025-32054,"Based on the provided CVE description, I would categorize it as follows:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Here's my reasoning for each component:

- Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely by default but doesn't prevent a network attack.

- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) - A high complexity score indicates that the exploit would likely require significant resources, time, and effort to execute.

- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - No privileges are required as this is an informational disclosure issue, which means there's no need to escalate or run any code.

- User Interaction (UI): None (N) - The vulnerability does not require user interaction for exploitation, making it a purely passive exploit.

- Scope (S): Changed (C) - The scope of the vulnerability is changed since the information disclosed will be in the system logs rather than being directly exploitable. This makes it more difficult to determine if an attack would succeed without knowing the details of the target's environment.

- Confidentiality (C): Low (L) - As this primarily involves logging sensitive data, there may be some impact on confidentiality, but generally, it will not cause significant harm in terms of sensitive data exposure compared to higher-level vulnerabilities that could lead to more severe breaches.

- Integrity (I): Low (L) - Since the vulnerability mainly results in information disclosure without causing any modification to the integrity of the system's state, this would be considered low risk.

- Availability (A): Low (L) - While there is a potential for an availability impact due to network or logging impacts on resources, it is generally considered low compared to more severe vulnerabilities that could lead to complete denial of service."
CVE-2025-32111,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE, we need to identify and assign values to each component of the vector. Here are the steps:

1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that there is no indication of remote code execution without privilege escalation or user interaction, I'm going to choose a value of `N` (Network) as it's the most appropriate choice for this scenario.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The provided CVE description does not explicitly state how hard an attacker needs to try to exploit the vulnerability. However, since Docker images are pre-defined and built according to a specific workflow, exploiting them might require some manual effort but not necessarily complex steps. Thus, I'll assign `H` (High) to this component.

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The provided CVE description does not explicitly state the privileges required to exploit the vulnerability. Since it is related to Docker images and there's no mention of escalating privileges beyond the normal user's permissions, I will assign `N` for ""None"".

4. **User Interaction (UI)**: There is no explicit indication that an attacker needs user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore, I'll choose `N` (None).

5. **Scope (S)**: Since this vulnerability involves a Docker image build process and does not provide any sensitive information outside the container's scope, it affects the unchanged data. Hence, I will assign `U` for Unchanged.

6. **Confidentiality (C)**: Given that Docker images are typically used in production environments where sensitive data is stored inside containers, the confidentiality impact of this vulnerability would be considered High.

7. **Integrity (I)**: Similar to Confidentiality, since Docker images and their contents are critical for integrity within a containerized environment, I will also assign `H` (High) to Integrity.

8. **Availability (A)**: The availability impact is High due to the potential disruption of Docker image build processes, which can lead to service interruptions if not addressed promptly.

Therefore, based on the provided information and using the CVSS 3.1 vector format guidelines, here's the generated vector:

CVE-2025-32113,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE, we need to break down the given description into its respective components:

- **AV:** Attack Vector
  - Given that this is a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in a web application (typically a browser-based attack), it's likely an Adjacent (A) or possibly Network (N) vector since no user interaction is mentioned and the exploit is performed over the network. Given the lack of specificity, we will assume **AV:N**.

- **AC:** Attack Complexity
  - Since this issue affects a web application and involves Cross Site Request Forgery, it's likely to be an **H** (High) complexity attack as this would involve social engineering or exploiting common website vulnerabilities.

- **PR:** Privileges Required
  - Given the nature of this vulnerability as a Cross-Site Request Forgery, no special privileges are required to exploit it. Therefore, we select **N** for No Privileges Required.

- **UI:** User Interaction
  - This is not an interaction that requires user action on their behalf, so it's best categorized as None (N).

- **S:** Scope
  - Since this issue affects data on the server and potentially any connected device if the website in question has a redirect to another server without proper validation, the scope could be considered Changed (C) for data integrity, especially considering the potential for malicious redirects.

- **C:** Confidentiality
  - This vulnerability primarily impacts data privacy. Therefore, we select High (H) to indicate confidentiality breaches are significant.

- **I:** Integrity
  - Given that this is about data and specifically about altering or manipulating it without the user's knowledge, integrity (or lack thereof) could be considered a concern. However, considering the nature of CSRF as typically not causing immediate data destruction but more so manipulation or alteration, we select Low (L) for this category.

- **A:** Availability

The described vulnerability is a SQL Injection issue, which is typically classified as an 'Unchanged' scope (S:U) since the attack does not rely on exploiting sensitive data but rather injecting malicious input into a request, regardless of whether the system's configuration or the user's privileges change.


This type of SQL injection attack doesn't inherently require special privileges to execute. Therefore, it falls under ""None"" for both Privileges Required (PR:N) and User Interaction (UI:N).


The vulnerability also does not affect confidentiality (C:N), integrity (I:N), or availability (A:N) since it is primarily focused on modifying the SQL commands to inject malicious data rather than accessing sensitive information directly, altering system state, or preventing legitimate operations.


Given that SQL injection attacks typically do not involve an attack vector that involves physical access or transmission over a network, and considering the nature of this vulnerability as an input-based attack, it falls under ""Adjacent"" (AV:A) since the attacker might be on the same machine or network as the server, but does not require them to physically touch it.


Finally, considering its classification as 'SQL Injection,' which is a high-risk type of vulnerability and often has a medium complexity for exploitation in non-technical contexts due to its inherent difficulty without extensive knowledge or technical expertise:

CVE-2025-32136,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the provided CVE ID and description, we need to analyze the vulnerability based on the given components:

- Attack Vector (AV): Local
- Attack Complexity (AC): Medium
- Privileges Required (PR): None
- User Interaction (UI): None
- Scope (S): Changed
- Confidentiality (C): High
- Integrity (I): Low
- Availability (A): High

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/I:L/A:H"
CVE-2025-32137,"To generate the CVSS vector for the provided CVE, we will analyze the given information:

- Attack Vector (AV): The vulnerability is a path traversal issue. This type of attack can be launched remotely, so it's not possible to get an attacker to send a malicious request to the system. The closest match from the options provided is 'Network' (N).

- Attack Complexity (AC): Since this is a relative path traversal vulnerability in Cristián Lávaque s2Member, which can lead to various types of attacks such as directory traversal or file inclusion, it could be considered ""High"" complexity. However, based on the description, we are only given that the issue allows Path Traversal. Therefore, we will select 'H' (High) as the complexity.

- Privileges Required (PR): The vector does not specify how much privileges the attacker would need to execute malicious code or access sensitive data. Since we don't have enough information about this, we can select ""None"" for this component.

- User Interaction (UI): For a remote path traversal attack where an attacker is exploiting vulnerabilities in the web server application without requiring any interaction from the user's system, the vector suggests 'None' (N) as the appropriate value.

- Scope (S): Since there was a specific version of s2Member affected by this vulnerability and considering that our focus is on the vulnerability aspect rather than the product scope, we will select 'Changed (C)'.

- Confidentiality (C): The attack vector in question does not explicitly mention anything about data confidentiality. However, given its potential to be used for more dangerous attacks like code injection or executing system commands, it can lead to unauthorized access to the affected application's resources. Therefore, this could potentially be classified as 'High' (H).

- Integrity (I): Similar to the previous point, since the issue affects the integrity of the application, we will select 'High' (H) for this component.

- Availability (A): There is no information that would suggest an attacker could use this vulnerability for denial-of-service attacks or prevent legitimate users from accessing their data. However, without specific details on how the system responds to successful path traversal attempts, we can reasonably choose 'Low' (L).

Now that we have analyzed the given CVE description, here's the CVSS vector based on our findings:

CVE-2025-32141,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, I'll analyze the description and assign values to each component based on the provided guidelines:

- AV: Attack Vector
  - Network (N): The attack can be initiated from outside the network but does not require network access.
  - Adjacent (A): The attack can be initiated from adjacent networks.
  - Local (L): The attack requires local access to the target.
  - Physical (P): This option is not valid in this scenario.

- AC: Attack Complexity
  - High (H): The attack involves a high degree of planning and resources.

- PR: Privileges Required
  - None (N): The exploit does not require privileges or special permissions.

- UI: User Interaction
  - None (N): No user interaction is required.

- S: Scope
  - Unchanged (U): The scope of the attack remains unchanged, but this might not fit perfectly as the vulnerability could be affected by a remote attacker. However, considering the local file inclusion and potential for privilege escalation without requiring network access in some cases, it leans towards 'Unchanged' due to the given options.

- C: Confidentiality
  - High (H): The exploit has high confidentiality implications because it can lead to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data.

- I: Integrity
  - Low (L): The vulnerability affects the integrity of the system but does not have a significant impact on its security posture, as the primary concern is confidentiality.

- A: Availability
  - High (H): The exploit has high availability implications because it can lead to downtime or reduce functionality.

    - PR:N

- **UI (User Interaction)**: The attack is remotely executed without any interaction required by the user.

    - UI:N

- **S (Scope)**: While there's no mention of changed data being accessed or affected directly, and given that this is a local file inclusion vulnerability which might affect system integrity indirectly through potential payload execution, we'll align it with 'Changed' as per the description impact scope.

    - S:C

- **C (Confidentiality)**: The PHP Remote File Inclusion vulnerability can lead to code execution on the server. This has high confidentiality implications due to potentially accessing sensitive data directly or executing arbitrary commands. However, because of PHP's behavior and the typical impact being more about the control over which files are accessed rather than direct data exposure, we'll align it with 'Low' here.

    - C:L

- **I (Integrity)**: This vulnerability can cause system integrity issues by allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to a low to moderate impact on the integrity of the system. However, considering the primary focus of 'low' as the general default for confidentiality in CVSS vectors and aligning with the given options, it's set to 'Low'.

    - I:L

- **A (Availability)**: The vulnerability impacts the availability of the server due to its ability to execute arbitrary commands. Therefore, this is an Availability vulnerability.

- **AV (Attack Vector):** Since this is a remote attack where an attacker doesn't need local access on the target system, the Attack Vector is set to N (Network).
- **AC (Attack Complexity):** The proper control of filenames for include and require statements in PHP programs is a basic security measure. Thus, the complexity of exploiting this vulnerability is low; it's more about configuration or setup issues rather than complex vulnerabilities that require extensive interaction with the system.
- **PR (Privileges Required):** The attacker doesn't need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability because it involves local file inclusion, which can be done without needing administrative access.
- **UI (User Interaction):** Since this is a server-side attack where an attacker does not interact directly with the user, the User Interaction is set to N (None).
- **S (Scope):** The scope of this vulnerability affects the data stored on the server since it's about local file inclusion. Therefore, the Scope is set to C (Changed) because the system's behavior changes in terms of access and modification of files.
- **C (Confidentiality):** Given that this involves accessing and modifying files directly, there's a significant risk of sensitive data being exposed or manipulated by an attacker. Thus, the Confidentiality level is H (High).
- **I (Integrity):** Since an attacker can manipulate files directly on the server without needing any elevated privileges, there's a high risk that the integrity of these files and potentially other parts of the system are compromised.
- **A (Availability):** This vulnerability does not necessarily cause immediate unavailability of the entire system. However, it compromises the confidentiality and integrity of data stored locally on the server, which could indirectly affect availability if sensitive information is accessed or manipulated.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"
CVE-2025-32172,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze the attack vector (AV), attack complexity (AC), privileges required (PR), user interaction (UI), scope (S), confidentiality (C), integrity (I), and availability (A) based on the provided information.

From the description, the vulnerability allows Stored XSS, which is an Attack Vector of Network (N) since it can be exploited remotely. The attack complexity seems to be High (H) because the description implies a potentially significant impact on the system's security. There are no specific privileges required (PR), as it doesn't mention any elevated permissions or access restrictions that need to be bypassed. This suggests Privileges Required is None (N).

The user interaction (UI) is required for this type of attack, indicating that some form of user action or input is needed to exploit the vulnerability, which aligns with User Interaction being Required (R). However, since the description doesn't explicitly state it's a Stored XSS issue affecting the client-side rendering without any external user input, we might consider UI as None (N) if we strictly follow the definition of Storedd XSS where it happens on the server-side. But typically for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities which are more common and can be exploited by users themselves when using their own websites or services that do not properly secure against such attacks, User Interaction would indeed be Required.

The scope of this vulnerability is Unchanged (U) because the description doesn't specify any changes in data access controls beyond allowing cross-site scripting. There's no mention of increasing privileges to read or modify sensitive information or altering data storage or transmission methods that could change the scope, implying it remains unchanged (U).

This cross-site scripting issue affects Confidentiality and Integrity but not High-level Confidentiality. It impacts the integrity because if an attacker can inject malicious scripts they could manipulate user data, though given the nature of a cross-site scripting vulnerability, confidentiality isn't impacted as there's no sensitive information being intercepted or exposed.

Lastly, this is a Stored XSS vulnerability which attacks Availability (A) since it allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to significant downtime and impact the functionality of the application, thus impacting its availability (A).

Based on these considerations, the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE-2025-32172 would be:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"

CVE-2025-32174,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, I'll analyze the description and assign values based on the provided guidelines.


AV: Network (N) - The attack doesn't require a local access.

AC: High (H) - Due to the severity of DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.

PR: None (N) - This issue does not affect privileges or access levels.

UI: Required (R) - Users must interact with the application to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2025-32261,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we'll analyze the description:

- **AV**: Network (N) is appropriate since it's a web-based application vulnerability.
- **AC**: Medium to High (H) due to potential complexity in exploiting or mitigating the CSRF attack, especially considering the lack of any specific implementation details provided.
- **PR**: None (N) because this vulnerability doesn't require any specific privileges for exploitation.
- **UI**: Required (R) as a user needs to interact with the vulnerable part of the application for the CSRF attack to work.
- **S**: Unchanged (U) since the scope remains the same, i.e., the web application is still vulnerable regardless of actions taken by users or other external factors.
- **C**: Low (L) because although it's a potential for data exposure due to the nature of the attack, the actual impact might be less if the user doesn't have sensitive information stored in the browser.
- **I**: Medium (M) would be more accurate. There isn't specific mention of data modification directly caused by this vulnerability, but integrity could still be compromised indirectly through potential misuse of a CSRF attack leading to unauthorized actions that affect the user's experience or data they interact with.
- **A**: Low (L) since the system is likely to remain operational and accessible despite this vulnerability.

CVE-2025-32264,"To generate the CVSS vector for the given CVE, we need to analyze the provided information and map it to the corresponding CVSS 3.1 vector components.

Based on the description:

- Attack Vector (AV): The attack can be launched remotely, so AV is Network (N).

- Attack Complexity (AC): Given that the vulnerability affects a complex system (Elementor Lite) with no clear indication of ease or difficulty in exploiting, we should consider AC as High (H).

- Privileges Required (PR): Since the description doesn't explicitly state what privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, and considering it's a typical web application vulnerability which usually wouldn't require high-level system access, PR is None (N).

- User Interaction (UI): As this is a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack that can potentially launch without user interaction through malicious requests or links, we should consider UI as None (N), though in many cases UI could be Required depending on how exactly the attack exploits CSRF.

- Scope (S): This vulnerability does not change the scope of what data can be accessed or modified; it's an issue with a web application that relies on user input to execute malicious requests, so S is Unchanged (U).

- Confidentiality (C): Since this primarily involves exposure of user data through unauthorized access (cross-site request forgery attacks), we should consider C as High (H).

- Integrity (I): Similar to confidentiality, this attack's nature involves changing the state of a system by manipulating its web application logic; thus I is also High (H).

- Availability (A): As the primary issue does not inherently make the availability of the system lower in a general sense but can cause certain functionalities or areas to be inaccessible due to CSRF attacks, A should ideally be Low (L), although there's overlap with other vectors' assessments.

The given CVE (Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in Broadstreet Broadstreet) matches with this standard format vector"
CVE-2025-32271,"To generate the CVSS 3.1 vector for the given CVE ID and description, I need to analyze the information provided and match it with the corresponding CVSS 3.1 metrics.

Based on the provided information, the vulnerability is classified as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) which falls under the category of a Network attack vector (`AV:N`). The Attack Complexity is High (`AC:H`) since this type of vulnerability often requires some level of user interaction to execute. Since there are no privileges required for this exploitation, it would fall under `PR:N`.

Given that the attack may not require user interaction directly but exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities could trigger unintended interactions, I would categorize it as `UI:N`. However, in practical scenarios, obtaining direct user interaction might be a common scenario.

The scope of this vulnerability is Unchanged (`S:U`), which means it doesn't change the existing functionality of the system or application. The Confidentiality and Integrity impacts are Low since CSRF vulnerabilities primarily affect data privacy by allowing unauthorized actions to be performed on behalf of a legitimate user, not necessarily compromising confidentiality (accessing sensitive data) or integrity (modifying data).

The availability impact is High (`A:H`), as successful exploitation can lead to significant disruption in the service or application's functionality.
