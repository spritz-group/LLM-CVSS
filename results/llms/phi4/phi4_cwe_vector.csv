CVE-2025-28882,"To determine a CVSS score for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, we must consider several factors about how the vulnerability is exploited and its potential impact.

- **Attack Vector (AV):** XSS vulnerabilities are generally considered to be exploitable over a network because they involve injecting scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Therefore, AV is ""N"" for Network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** XSS can often be exploited with user interactions such as clicking on a link or submitting a form. Thus, AC is usually ""L"" for Low.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Most XSS attacks do not require any special privileges from the victim's side to execute successfully. Therefore, PR is ""N"" for None.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Often, user interaction is required, such as clicking on a malicious link or visiting a compromised webpage. Hence, UI is ""R"" for Required.

- **Scope (S):** XSS generally affects the same security context as the original request, so Scope is ""U"" for Unchanged.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), and Availability Impact (A):**
  - **Confidentiality:** If an attacker can steal session cookies or other sensitive information via XSS, this would result in a High impact. Therefore, C is ""H"".
  - **Integrity:** XSS often allows attackers to modify data viewed by the user, such as displaying false information or defacing websites, leading to a High integrity impact. Thus, I is ""H"".
  - **Availability:** Typically, XSS does not directly affect availability unless combined with other techniques (e.g., using XSS for a denial of service). Therefore, A is ""L"" for Low.

Given these assessments, the CVSS vector string for a typical XSS vulnerability would be:

CVE-2025-28889,"To provide a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), we need to consider various factors that influence the base metrics of the scoring system: Attack Vector (AV), Attack Complexity (AC), Privileges Required (PR), User Interaction (UI), Scope (S), and Impact on Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A). Here’s a breakdown based on typical XSS characteristics:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local or Network. Since XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploited via the web, where an attacker injects malicious scripts into content viewed by other users, the appropriate vector is ""Network"" (N).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low. Exploiting XSS usually requires minimal effort to execute once a vulnerable site is found, as it leverages existing user interactions and trusted relationships.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None. An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit XSS vulnerabilities beyond what they already have as a regular user of the application.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required. To execute the attack, some level of interaction from an end-user is typically required, such as clicking on a link or visiting a crafted URL.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged. XSS generally affects only one part of the system and does not alter other components or processes beyond its immediate context.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** High. XSS can expose sensitive information to unauthorized users by capturing data entered into forms or viewing private content.

- **Integrity Impact (I):** High. The malicious scripts can alter data, perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent, and disrupt normal operations.

- **Availability Impact (A):** None. XSS does not typically affect system availability, as it doesn't involve denial-of-service attacks or similar disruptions.

Based on these considerations, a typical CVSS 3.1 vector for an XSS vulnerability might look like:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

**Explanation of Vector Components:**

- **Attack Vector (AV): Network**
  - CSRF vulnerabilities can be exploited over the network, as the attacker crafts malicious requests that are sent from a victim's browser.

- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low**
  - The attack does not require significant conditions to succeed. An attacker simply needs to trick the user into submitting a forged request.

- **Privileges Required (PR): None**
  - No special privileges are required on the target system; any authenticated user can be exploited if they perform an action initiated by the attacker.

- **User Interaction (UI): Required**
  - The attack relies on some form of user interaction, as the victim must visit a malicious site or execute a deceptive link to trigger the CSRF request.

- **Scope (S): Changed**
  - The impact extends beyond the resources that are directly vulnerable. Successful exploitation can lead to changes in session state or other data persistence mechanisms.

- **Confidentiality (C): High**
  - A successful exploit could allow access to sensitive information, especially if the victim is an administrator or holds privileged accounts.

- **Integrity (I): High**
  - The attacker could potentially alter data or perform actions that modify the application state without authorization.

- **Availability (A): High**
  - Depending on the actions performed by the attacker, they may be able to disrupt service availability, such as deleting critical data or services."
CVE-2025-28911,"To determine the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), we'll consider typical characteristics of XSS vulnerabilities:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: XSS typically involves a network-based attack, so `AV:N` (Network).
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: XSS attacks are usually straightforward if the application is vulnerable, so `AC:L` (Low).
- **Privileges Required (PR)**: No privileges are needed to exploit an XSS vulnerability, so `PR:N` (None).
- **User Interaction (UI)**: Depending on the type of XSS:
  - Stored or reflected XSS often requires some user interaction to trigger the payload, so `UI:R` (Required).
- **Scope (S)**: If the vulnerability affects only a single component, it's `S:N` (None). If it can affect other components, it would be `S:C` (Changed). Typically for XSS, scope remains unchanged.
- **Confidentiality Impact (C)**: Since XSS can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, the impact is often high, so `C:H`.
- **Integrity Impact (I)**: As XSS can alter user sessions or data, this is usually high, so `I:H`.
- **Availability Impact (A)**: XSS typically doesn't affect availability directly, so `A:N` (None).

Putting these together, the CVSS vector for a typical XSS vulnerability would be:

CVE-2025-28919,"To determine a likely CVSS 3.1 vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities based on the given context, we can make educated assumptions about each metric:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** XSS attacks typically require user interaction to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser. This makes them **Local (L)** rather than Network (N), Physical (P), or Adjacent Network (A).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** These vulnerabilities often have a low complexity because they exploit input validation failures that are straightforward to trigger by simply injecting script tags.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** XSS typically does not require elevated privileges. The attacker can execute scripts in the context of an already authenticated user, making this **None (N)**.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Since XSS relies on tricking users into clicking links or interacting with web pages that contain malicious scripts, it involves user interaction (**Required (R)**).

- **Scope (S):** If the vulnerability leads to a change in the scope of access (e.g., from one user context to another), this would be **Changed (C)**. However, typical XSS attacks do not affect the application's overall state or data integrity beyond their own execution environment, so it is often **Unchanged (U)**.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** XSS can lead to unauthorized access to session cookies or other sensitive information stored in the browser, impacting confidentiality, thus considered a **High (H)** impact.

- **Integrity Impact (I):** XSS can allow attackers to alter web page content seen by users, potentially leading to misinformation or data manipulation from their perspective, so it's a **High (H)** impact.

- **Availability Impact (A):** XSS typically does not impact the availability of the application itself, so this is considered a **None (N)** impact.

Combining these assumptions, a likely CVSS 3.1 vector for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities would be:

CVE-2025-30005,"To construct a CVSS 3.1 vector for path traversal vulnerabilities, we need to consider various aspects such as access vector (AV), attack complexity (AC), privileges required (PR), user interaction (UI), scope (S), and the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C/I/A). Here's how these factors might be evaluated:

- **Access Vector (AV)**: This is about how the attacker needs to access the vulnerability. Common options include:
  - N: Network
  - A: Adjacent network
  - L: Local

  For path traversal, it typically involves local interaction with a web application or server.

- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: This reflects the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist to exploit the vulnerability.
  - H: High - Special conditions are required.
  - M: Medium - Some conditions are required.
  - L: Low - No special conditions are necessary.

  Path traversal generally has low complexity as it involves manipulating path inputs to access files outside of a web root directory.

- **Privileges Required (PR)**: This indicates the level of privileges an attacker must have to exploit the vulnerability.
  - N: None
  - L: Low - Logon is required.
  - H: High - Administrative privileges are needed.

  Usually, no special privileges are needed for path traversal.

- **User Interaction (UI)**: This describes whether user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
  - N: None
  - R: Required

  Path traversal often does not require any user interaction beyond inputting or crafting malicious requests.

- **Scope (S)**: Scope indicates whether a vulnerability in one component impacts resources beyond its security scope.
  - U: Unchanged - The attack on one component does not affect resources outside of that component's security scope.
  - C: Changed - The attack can impact resources outside the affected component’s security scope.

  Typically, path traversal does not change the scope as it affects only files within the same application or server.

- **Confidentiality (C)**, **Integrity (I)**, and **Availability (A)** impacts:
  - X: None
  - L: Low
  - M: Medium
  - H: High

  The impact depends on what is accessed via path traversal. If sensitive files are accessed or modified, confidentiality and integrity can be high.

Considering these factors, a typical CVSS 3.1 vector for a straightforward path traversal vulnerability could look like this:

`CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:M/A:L`

This assumes that sensitive files are accessed (high confidentiality), data integrity might be compromised if file contents are altered, and availability is low since typical path traversal doesn't usually result in denial of service. Adjustments may be necessary based on specific circumstances or additional context about the vulnerability's impact."

- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Given the detailed defenses and mitigations, exploiting this might require bypassing multiple layers of security, making it ""High"".

- **Privileges Required (PR)**: The need for environment hardening and sandboxing implies that no special privileges are necessary for exploitation; thus, ""None"" is appropriate.

- **User Interaction (UI)**: Since the vulnerability involves user-controlled input crossing language boundaries, it likely requires some form of interaction to exploit. Therefore, ""Required"".

- **Scope (S)**: The presence of environment hardening and sandboxing suggests that if an attack occurs, it might be contained within a particular process or execution context, indicating ""Unchanged"" scope.

- **Confidentiality (C)**: There is no direct mention of data exposure, so the impact on confidentiality would likely be ""None"".

- **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability involves crossing language boundaries, which could potentially alter application state or logic, suggesting a ""Low"" impact on integrity.

CVE-2025-30529,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H  

This assessment is based on a CSRF vulnerability which typically has the following characteristics:

- **Attack Vector (AV): Network** - The attack can be initiated over a network, as it involves tricking users to perform actions via requests sent from another site.
- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low** - Exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities generally does not require complex conditions to succeed.
- **Privileges Required (PR): None** - The attacker requires no prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability; they rely on the victim's authenticated session.
- **User Interaction (UI): Required** - User interaction is required, as the attack involves convincing the user to perform an action that initiates the CSRF request.
- **Scope (S): Changed** - Successful exploitation can change the state of the application beyond its intended function, especially if it affects operations requiring higher privileges like an administrator's actions.
- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A): High** - All three aspects are affected since CSRF can lead to unauthorized data access or modification and potentially disrupt availability."
CVE-2025-30530,"To determine the most appropriate Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), we need to evaluate each component based on its typical characteristics:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploited over a network, making ""N"" (Network) the suitable choice.
  
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** XSS often requires minimal complexity from an attacker as it usually involves injecting scripts through inputs that are not properly sanitized. Thus, ""L"" (Low) is appropriate.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Generally, no privileges beyond those of a regular user are needed to exploit XSS vulnerabilities, so ""N"" (None) fits here.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Successful exploitation usually requires some form of user interaction, such as visiting a malicious link. Therefore, ""R"" (Required) is suitable.

- **Scope (S):** XSS does not generally affect resources beyond those intended for the vulnerable component; hence ""U"" (Unchanged) is appropriate.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), and Availability Impact (A):** The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability can vary. Typically, XSS impacts confidentiality (""H"" for High) due to potential exposure of sensitive information through script execution in the user's browser context. However, it usually does not alter data or affect system availability directly, so ""L"" (Low) is appropriate for both Integrity and Availability.

Considering these evaluations, a suitable CVSS 3.1 vector for XSS would be:

CVE-2025-30544,"To create a CVSS 3.1 vector for an XSS vulnerability, you need to assess various metrics that define its characteristics:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** 
  - `N` (Network) if exploited over a network
  - `A` (Adjacent Network)
  - `L` (Local)
  - `P` (Physical)

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**

- **PR**: `N`, as no special privileges are generally needed to exploit it
- **UI**: `N` or `R`, depending on whether the attack can be executed automatically or needs user interaction (like clicking a link)
- **S**: `U`, usually XSS does not change the scope unless it triggers additional vulnerabilities
- **C, I, A**:
  - **C**: Can vary; typically `L` if sensitive data is displayed but not manipulated
  - **I**: Usually `X` because integrity of data isn't directly affected by XSS
  - **A**: Often `L`, as it might disrupt the user's experience but doesn't completely stop service

CVE-2025-30547,"To assess a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1, we need to consider various metrics that describe characteristics of an attack and its potential impact. Here's a breakdown of these components:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** This describes how the vulnerability is exploited.
  - **N (Network):** The vulnerable component is accessible over a network.
  - **A (Adjacent Network):** Exploitation requires access to a network that is physically or logically adjacent to the one used by the victim.
  - **L (Local):** Requires local access with high privileges on the vulnerable system, such as being able to load and execute arbitrary code within an AppContainer sandbox environment in Windows. This does not include actions performed by users of the vulnerable application.
  - **P (Physical):** Requires physical proximity.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** This describes the conditions beyond the attacker's control that must exist to exploit the vulnerability.
  - **H (High):** Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances are required to exploit the vulnerability.
  - **L (Low):** The attack can be performed under normal conditions.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** This describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.
  - **H (High):** Successful exploitation requires privileges that provide user-level access.
  - **L (Low):** The attacker is unauthorized to log into the system; no user privileges are required.

- **User Interaction Required (UI):** This describes the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component.
  - **N (None):** No user interaction required for exploitation.
  - **R (Required):** The vulnerable system must be made interactable with a human user, beyond the initial act of breaching its defenses.

- **Scope (S):** This describes whether a vulnerability in one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.
  - **U (Unchanged):** Exploitation of the vulnerability does not impact resources outside of the attacked component’s security scope.
  - **C (Changed):** Exploitation of the vulnerability impacts other components beyond its security scope.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), Availability Impact (A):** These describe the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability respectively if the vulnerability is successfully exploited.
  - **N (None):** No impact.
  - **L (Low):** Low impact.
  - **H (High):** High impact.

For a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability:

- **Attack Vector:** XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploitable over a network, so we use **AV:N**.
- **Attack Complexity:** Most XSS attacks do not require special conditions beyond crafting the malicious script, thus **AC:L** is appropriate.
- **Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have specific privileges; they simply inject and execute scripts via user input vectors. Therefore, we use **PR:N**.
- **User Interaction Required:** Often, successful exploitation of an XSS vulnerability requires the victim to interact with the malicious script (e.g., by clicking a link), so we use **UI:R**.
- **Scope:** An XSS attack typically does not affect components beyond its security scope. So, we use **S:U**.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** If sensitive data is exposed via an XSS flaw, this can be significant; thus, we often assign **C:H**.
- **Integrity Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities can manipulate or alter web content in the context of a victim's session. This can lead to high impact depending on how scripts are used, so **I:H** might apply.
- **Availability Impact:** Typically, XSS does not affect system availability directly, so we use **A:N**.

Therefore, for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, a typical CVSS 3.1 vector could be:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
```"
CVE-2025-30548,"To determine the appropriate CVSS:3.1 vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), consider the following characteristics:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local (L) if the attack requires physical access, Network (N) if it can be performed remotely over a network.
- **Access Complexity (AC):** Low (L) if no special conditions are required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability. High (H) if specific conditions or privileges are needed.
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) if no privileges are needed, Low (L) if low-level user privileges are necessary, High (H) if high-level privileges are required.
- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R) if the attack requires some action from a user, such as clicking a link. None (N) if no user interaction is needed.
- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) if the vulnerability does not affect resources beyond its security authority. Changed (C) if it impacts resources beyond its authority.
- **Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), Availability Impact (A):** None (N) if there is no impact, Low (L) for a minor impact, High (H) for significant impact.

For XSS vulnerabilities, the typical CVSS vector is:

`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N`

Explanation of the decision:
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N) because CSRF vulnerabilities are typically exploited over a network, allowing remote attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) as it generally requires only a convincing request that can be crafted without significant difficulty or specialized knowledge.
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) since the attack exploits existing user sessions and does not require additional privileges beyond those already held by the victim's account.
- **User Interaction (UI):** Required (R) because the attacker needs some form of interaction from the victim, such as clicking a link or loading an image, to perform the CSRF attack.
- **Scope (S):** Changed (C) due to potential access to other users' data and actions through the compromised session, which can affect more than just confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the victim's own data.
- **Confidentiality (C):** High (H) as sensitive data could be accessed or manipulated if the victim has access to such data.
- **Integrity (I):** High (H) because an attacker might modify application data without proper authorization by performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Availability (A):** High (H) if the CSRF attack involves destructive operations that can significantly disrupt service availability."

- **Availability (A):** None (N), as CSRF typically doesn't impact availability directly."
CVE-2025-30551,"To generate a CVSS vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities based on the provided information, we need to consider several factors from the description:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** The attacks are typically remote because they exploit user inputs that are processed by a web application over HTTP/HTTPS. Thus, the attack vector is `Network`.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** XSS often requires some understanding of how input processing and output rendering work in the application but does not necessarily require complex conditions to be met. It can usually be executed with readily available tools and techniques, so the attack complexity is `Low`.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Typically, no special privileges are needed to execute an XSS attack; it exploits vulnerabilities in how a web application handles user inputs regardless of the user's session or role. Therefore, this is `None`.

- **User Interaction (UI):** In most cases, XSS attacks can be executed without any interaction from the victim once they are lured into visiting a malicious URL. Hence, user interaction is `None`.

- **Scope (S):** XSS vulnerabilities generally do not change the scope of the attack; they exploit the same application context to execute scripts. Thus, this would typically be `Unchanged`.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), and Availability Impact (A):** These impacts can vary significantly based on how the XSS vulnerability is exploited:
  - **Confidentiality Impact:** If sensitive data is accessed via the XSS attack (e.g., cookies, session tokens), this impact would be `High`.
  - **Integrity Impact:** If the attacker can modify content or perform actions as if they were a user with higher privileges, then integrity could also be `High`. However, without specifics on such privilege escalation, it often remains `Low` for XSS.
  - **Availability Impact:** Typically, an XSS vulnerability does not affect the availability of a service directly unless coupled with other techniques (e.g., DoS via script execution). Therefore, this is usually `None`.

Based on these considerations, a typical CVSS vector for an XSS vulnerability might look like:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
``` 

This vector represents a common scenario for XSS vulnerabilities where confidentiality can be high due to access to sensitive information, but integrity and availability impacts are often lower unless additional factors or exploits are involved."

CVE-2025-30565,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Explanation of the Vector Components:

- **AV (Attack Vector): N**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable over a network, as it involves a CSRF attack which typically requires the victim to be tricked into interacting with a malicious link or payload delivered via the web.

- **AC (Attack Complexity): L**  
  Attack complexity is low because executing this vulnerability does not require complex conditions; simply tricking the user into submitting a request suffices.

- **PR (Privileges Required): N**  
  No privileges are required on the target system for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability, aside from the victim's interaction with the malicious request.

- **UI (User Interaction): N**  
  Although CSRF requires some form of user action, in the context of CVSS scoring, ""N"" indicates that there is no need for further interaction after the initial exploitation step by the attacker. The user’s action triggers the vulnerability without needing additional input from the attacker at the moment of exploit.

- **S (Scope): C**  
  The scope is changed because exploiting this CSRF can lead to unauthorized access and modification of resources, potentially affecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability beyond just the immediate context of a single request.

- **C (Confidentiality): H**  
  Confidentiality is highly impacted as an attacker could gain unauthorized read access to sensitive application data if they successfully exploit this vulnerability.

- **I (Integrity): H**  
  Integrity is also highly impacted because the attacker can modify application data, such as user profiles or critical configuration settings.

- **A (Availability): H**  
  Availability is considered highly impacted due to potential denial-of-service scenarios where an attacker could disrupt service availability through unauthorized requests leading to system crashes or resource exhaustion."
CVE-2025-30566,"To create a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), we need to consider several factors that affect the severity of such vulnerabilities. Here's how each component is typically assessed:

- **AV (Attack Vector):** 
  - XSS can be delivered through various means, but it often involves web applications where user inputs are reflected back in HTTP responses. This aligns with `AV:N` for network.

- **AC (Attack Complexity):**
  - XSS vulnerabilities usually require some interaction from the victim, such as clicking a link or loading a malicious webpage. Thus, `AC:L` for low complexity is appropriate since it does not require intricate steps to exploit.

- **PR (Privileges Required):**
  - Typically, no special privileges are needed to exploit an XSS vulnerability beyond being able to interact with the application in some way (e.g., logging in as a regular user). This suggests `PR:N`.

- **UI (User Interaction):**
  - The attacker usually requires some level of interaction from the victim, such as clicking on a malicious link. Hence, `UI:R` for required is suitable.

- **S (Scope):**
  - XSS often affects a single attack vector without impacting other components or systems directly; thus, it's generally considered to have a scope impact of `S:U` for unchanged.

- **C (Confidentiality Impact):**
  - XSS can allow an attacker to access sensitive data displayed on the user's screen. This is typically rated as high impact: `C:H`.

- **I (Integrity Impact):**
  - XSS can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of a victim, such as form submissions or changes in account settings. This is also generally considered high impact: `I:H`.

- **A (Availability Impact):**
  - While XSS does not typically impact availability directly, it could be used in conjunction with other attacks to disrupt service. Therefore, the availability impact is usually low: `A:L`.

Given these assessments, a typical CVSS 3.1 vector for Cross-Site Scripting might look like this:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L

Explanation of each component in the context:

- **AV (Attack Vector): N**  
  The CSRF vulnerability typically involves network-based attacks, as it exploits vulnerabilities over the internet by making requests from a different domain.

- **AC (Attack Complexity): L**  
  Attack complexity is low because exploiting CSRF usually requires straightforward manipulation without needing to bypass additional defenses beyond those that are specifically in place for CSRF protection.

- **PR (Privileges Required): N**  
  Privileges required are none, as the attack can be executed from the victim’s browser session with no prior access needed. The attacker does not need any special privileges to make the request appear legitimate.

- **UI (User Interaction): N**  
  User interaction is typically not required for a CSRF attack once it's been set up via an initial bait or link, as the malicious action can be carried out automatically by visiting the crafted URL.

- **S (Scope): C**  
  The scope changes because the vulnerability allows actions that affect resources outside of the current user session context, particularly if administrative functions are involved.

- **C (Confidentiality): H**  
  Confidentiality is high as exploiting CSRF could allow an attacker to access and potentially leak sensitive data depending on what operations can be performed under the victim's identity.

- **I (Integrity): H**  
  Integrity is also high due to the potential for unauthorized modification of application data by performing actions that were not intended by the user.

- **A (Availability): N**  
  Availability is considered none as CSRF typically does not involve actions like denial-of-service or crashing the server but rather focuses on unauthorized actions affecting confidentiality and integrity."

CVE-2025-30595,"To assign a CVSS score to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities as described in your context, we need to consider several factors such as attack vector, complexity, privileges required, user interaction, scope, and impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Based on common characteristics of XSS:

- **AV (Attack Vector):** Network (since it typically involves web applications accessible over the network)
- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Low (as it often does not require complex conditions to exploit)
- **PR (Privileges Required):** None (attackers usually do not need any privileges on the target machine)
- **UI (User Interaction):** Required (the attack generally requires user interaction, like clicking a link or entering text in a form field)
- **S (Scope):** Changed (as XSS can lead to changes within a single user session or application context)
- **C (Confidentiality Impact):** High (sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, etc., can be accessed by an attacker)
- **I (Integrity Impact):** Medium (XSS can alter the content of a web page seen by users, but typically does not modify server-side data)
- **A (Availability Impact):** Low (the attack doesn't usually result in denial of service)

Given these factors, a typical CVSS score for XSS might be:

`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:M/A:L`

This vector represents a generalized case; specific instances may vary based on detailed context and implementation nuances."
CVE-2025-30596,"To provide a complete Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1 vector based on your description of path traversal vulnerabilities and their potential impacts, I'll outline each component's possible values:

- **AV (Attack Vector)**: This describes the context by which an attack is delivered.
  - `N`: Network
  - `A`: Adjacent network
  - `L`: Local
  - `P`: Physical

  For path traversal vulnerabilities that are often exploited via web applications, `AV:N` is a common choice.

- **AC (Attack Complexity)**: This indicates the conditions beyond the attacker's control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability.
  - `H`: High complexity
  - `L`: Low complexity

  Path traversal usually involves manipulating input directly accessible by the application, so `AC:L` is typically appropriate.

- **PR (Privileges Required)**: This describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.
  - `N`: None
  - `L`: Low
  - `H`: High

  Path traversal often requires no additional privileges beyond what the application provides, so `PR:N` is common.

- **UI (User Interaction)**: This indicates whether a successful attack can be achieved with or without interaction from any user.
  - `N`: None
  - `R`: Required

  These attacks generally don't require user interaction after initiating the request, so `UI:N` is typical.

- **S (Scope)**: This defines whether a vulnerability in one component impacts resources beyond its security scope.
  - `U`: Unchanged
  - `C`: Changed

  If the vulnerability only affects the application without impacting other components or systems, `S:U`.

- **C (Confidentiality Impact)**: The impact on confidentiality is measured as:
  - `H`: High
  - `L`: Low
  - `N`: None

  Path traversal can allow unauthorized access to sensitive files, so `C:H` is often applicable.

- **I (Integrity Impact)**: This measures the impact on integrity.
  - `H`: High
  - `L`: Low
  - `N`: None

  If an attacker modifies file contents through path traversal, `I:H`.

- **A (Availability Impact)**: The impact on availability is measured as:
  - `H`: High
  - `L`: Low
  - `N`: None

  Path traversal typically does not affect availability directly unless it leads to denial of service scenarios, so `A:N` might be appropriate.

Given these considerations, a possible CVSS vector for a path traversal vulnerability could look like this:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

  - The issue is related to SQL Injection, which typically requires some form of interaction with the application, such as a web request. This suggests an Access Vector of Network (AV:N).

- **Access Complexity (AC):**
  - Since it's a SQL Injection vulnerability, it usually doesn't require complex steps beyond crafting the injection itself. Therefore, AC is Low (AC:L).

- **Privileges Required (PR):**
  - The attack can be executed without any special privileges, so PR is None (PR:N).

- **User Interaction (UI):**
  - SQL Injection often requires some form of user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, such as submitting a malicious input. Thus, UI is Required (UI:R).

- **Scope (S):**
  - The attack does not affect resources beyond its security scope, so Scope is Unchanged (S:U).

- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) Impact:**

CVE-2025-30765,"To construct a CVSS 3.1 vector for an SQL injection vulnerability, we need to evaluate various metrics based on available information:

1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: 
   - Typically, SQL Injection vulnerabilities are exploitable over the network if they affect web applications. Thus, AV is generally Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**:
   - If exploitation requires specific knowledge or steps that make it more complex, AC would be High (H). Otherwise, Low (L) is common for straightforward SQL injections.

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**:
   - Often, these vulnerabilities can be exploited without any privileges beyond those of a normal user interacting with the application, so PR is usually None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI)**:
   - If exploitation requires interaction from a legitimate user, such as input through a form, UI is Required (R). Otherwise, it's None (N).

5. **Scope (S)**:
   - SQL Injection typically affects the same security context as the initial request, so Scope is Unchanged (U).

6. **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A) Impact**:
   - The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability can vary:
     - If an attacker can access sensitive data, C might be High (H).
     - If they can modify data, I is likely High (H).
     - If the application becomes unavailable or its functionality is disrupted, A could be High (H).

CVE-2025-30791,"To determine the CVSS vector for SQL Injection vulnerabilities like the one described, we need to consider several metrics within the CVSS 3.1 framework:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** SQL Injection typically exploits vulnerabilities through network interactions or inputs directly provided by users. Since it can be executed remotely via user input on a web application, the attack vector is usually ""Network"" (N).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Generally, exploiting SQL injection doesn't require special conditions beyond providing malicious input; hence, this metric would likely be ""Low"" (L).

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Typically, no privileges are needed to exploit an SQL Injection vulnerability directly. Thus, this is usually set as ""None"" (N).

- **User Interaction (UI):** If the attack can occur without any user interaction beyond initial access (e.g., automatic submission of malicious input), it's ""None"" (N). However, if some action by a victim is needed (like clicking on a link), it would be ""Required"" (R).

- **Scope (S):** SQL Injection typically affects the confidentiality and integrity within the same application without impacting other systems or applications. Therefore, this is usually ""Unchanged"" (U).

- **Impact Metrics:**
  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** If sensitive data can be accessed due to the injection, it's rated as ""High"" (H). Otherwise, if no confidentiality breach occurs, it's ""Low"" (L).
  - **Integrity Impact (I):** If the attack allows for modification of data or operations, it's ""High"" (H). If only read access is obtained without alteration capability, it would be ""Low"" (L).

CVE-2025-30806,"To determine a CVSS 3.1 score for this scenario, we need to consider various metrics based on the information provided and typical assumptions in cases where specific details are lacking:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Given that SQL Injection can be executed remotely via web interfaces or APIs without requiring physical access, it is generally classified as Network-based. Therefore, AV = N.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** The complexity of an attack depends on how difficult it is to exploit the vulnerability. Many SQL injection vulnerabilities are well-documented and tools exist that automate exploitation, typically making these exploits low in complexity. Thus, AC = L.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** This refers to the level of privileges needed by a threat actor to exploit the vulnerability. Since SQL Injection often occurs at the application layer without requiring elevated system-level privileges, PR = N (None).

- **User Interaction (UI):** Some exploits require user interaction like clicking a link or submitting data, while others can be executed automatically by an attacker's tooling. Given that many automated tools exist for exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities, UI is often set to None (N) in such scenarios.

- **Scope (S):** Scope refers to whether the impact on security requirements remains within the same security context or crosses trust boundaries. SQL Injection typically affects data confidentiality and integrity but does not usually cross application boundaries (e.g., from a web server to an underlying database). Thus, S = U (Unchanged).

The remaining metrics for Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) are not specified in the problem statement. In such cases, we'll assume a high impact on confidentiality and integrity due to SQL injection's potential to disclose data and modify it, but no direct impact on availability unless specifically mentioned.

- **User Interaction (UI):** The exploitation does not explicitly require user interaction once the vulnerability is identified and leveraged, so UI is ""N"".

- **Scope (S):** The impact remains within the same security context as the attacker already has access to (e.g., they can include files remotely but not affect other processes or systems), thus ""U"" (Unchanged).

- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A):** 
  - Confidentiality can be compromised if sensitive files are included, so ""H"".
  - Integrity is at risk if the attacker includes malicious scripts that alter data or behavior, hence ""H"".
  - Availability might not directly be impacted unless the inclusion leads to a denial of service, but it's prudent to consider a potential impact due to script execution leading to resource exhaustion or similar issues. Therefore, ""L"" (Low).

Given this analysis, the CVSS vector is:

### Explanation of Components:

- **AV (Attack Vector): N (Network)**  
  The vulnerability is exploitable over the network since it involves CSRF attacks that occur via client interactions with the server.

- **AC (Attack Complexity): L (Low)**  
  CSRF typically requires minimal complexity to exploit, as it leverages a user's authenticated session with no additional steps needed on the attacker’s part beyond crafting a malicious request.

- **PR (Privileges Required): N (None)**  
  No privileges are required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability since it relies on the victim being tricked into making requests from their own authenticated session.

- **UI (User Interaction): R (Required)**  
  User interaction is necessary as the victim must be induced to perform some action, such as clicking a link or visiting a malicious page that triggers the CSRF attack.

- **S (Scope): C (Changed)**  
  The scope changes because a successful exploitation could potentially affect other users' data in the same application session, especially if it involves administrative actions.

- **C (Confidentiality): H (High)**  
  A successful CSRF exploit can lead to unauthorized access and modification of sensitive data due to the user’s authenticated session being used maliciously.

- **I (Integrity): H (High)**  
  The integrity is at high risk because an attacker could perform actions like modifying or deleting application data under the victim's identity, impacting data accuracy and trustworthiness.

- **A (Availability): H (High)**  
  Availability is considered high because an attack could lead to denial of service for the legitimate user by performing destructive actions that disrupt their session."

CVE-2025-30971,"To create a CVSS 3.1 vector for an SQL injection vulnerability, we need to evaluate various components based on the given context and typical characteristics of such vulnerabilities.

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local or Network access is often required. If the application can be accessed remotely, use `AV:N`; otherwise, use `AV:L`. Given no explicit remote access information, assume `AV:N`.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Often low for SQL injection if input fields are easily accessible and do not have strong validation in place. Use `AC:L`.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** If the application requires elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability or none at all, use `PR:N`. Typically, no additional privileges are needed, so use `PR:N`.

- **User Interaction (UI):** If exploitation can occur without any user interaction, such as through automated scripts, use `UI:N`. Otherwise, use `UI:R` if some user action is required. Assume `UI:R` since SQL injections often require triggering specific conditions.

- **Scope (S):** Determine whether the impact of the vulnerability extends beyond the initially exploited component. If it does, use `S:C`; otherwise, use `S:N`. SQL injection can lead to data manipulation or exposure affecting other components, so assume `S:C`.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Data exposure often occurs with SQL injections, impacting confidentiality. Use `C:H` for high impact.

- **Integrity Impact (I):** Data modification is possible, affecting integrity. Use `I:H` for high impact.

CVE-2025-31043,"To generate a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), we need to consider various factors such as Attack Vector, Access Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, and Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

For XSS vulnerabilities:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Typically local or network since it involves interaction with a web application.
- **Access Complexity (AC):** Generally low because the attacker can exploit it by simply accessing a web page with malicious input.
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None, as no special privileges are needed to execute XSS attacks.
- **User Interaction (UI):** Required, since the user must interact with the malicious content for the attack to be successful.
- **Scope (S):** Unchanged, because exploiting an XSS vulnerability does not impact other resources or components outside of what is already affected by the application.
- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A) Impact:** These impacts can vary based on how data is stolen or manipulated. Commonly, it might be:
  - **Confidentiality (C):** Partial, if sensitive information is exposed but not all of it.
  - **Integrity (I):** Partial, if some modification occurs without full control over the application logic.
  - **Availability (A):** None, as XSS typically does not impact availability.

Considering these factors, a representative CVSS vector for an average XSS vulnerability might be:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** This indicates how the vulnerability is exploited.
   - N: Network
   - A: Adjacent Network
   - L: Local
   - P: Physical

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** Reflects conditions beyond an attacker's control that must exist to exploit the vulnerability.
   - H: High
   - L: Low

3. **Privileges Required (PR):** Describes the level of privileges needed by an attacker before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.
   - N: None
   - L: Low
   - H: High

4. **User Interaction (UI):** Indicates if user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
   - N: None
   - R: Required

5. **Scope (S):** Determines whether a vulnerability in one component affects resources beyond its security scope.
   - U: Unchanged
   - C: Changed

6. **Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), Availability Impact (A):** These metrics describe the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability respectively.
   - N: None
   - L: Low
   - H: High

Since I don't have specific details about the vulnerability's exploitability or impact from your input, you'll need to assess it based on its characteristics. Once assessed, you can fill in these metrics into the CVSS format:

```

CVE-2025-31099,"To determine a CVSS vector for this scenario, we need to make reasonable assumptions based on typical characteristics of SQL injection vulnerabilities and the context provided:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local attacks are typically not feasible for SQL injection as they generally require network access to exploit. Therefore, `AV:N` (Network) is assumed.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Since input validation and other measures might be partially implemented but not fully effective, we assume `AC:L` (Low).

- **Privileges Required (PR):** No specific privileges are mentioned as necessary for exploiting the SQL injection. Thus, `PR:N` (None) is assumed.

- **User Interaction (UI):** User interaction may be required to input malicious data into the application. Therefore, `UI:R` (Required).

- **Scope (S):** Given that the vulnerability could potentially allow unauthorized access across different security contexts (e.g., accessing sensitive user information), we assume a change in scope, hence `S:C`.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** The potential for data leaks suggests high confidentiality impact, so `C:H` is assumed.

- **Integrity Impact (I):** SQL injection could allow unauthorized modifications to the database, indicating a high integrity impact, thus `I:H`.

- **Availability Impact (A):** While possible, availability impact might be less direct unless specific denial-of-service tactics are used. Therefore, we assume `A:L` (Low).

CVE-2025-31131,"To determine the appropriate CVSS v3.1 vector for path traversal vulnerabilities, consider the following components:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Path traversal typically involves local file inclusion via a web application, making it exploitable over a network. Thus, AV is `N` (Network).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** The complexity can vary based on defenses in place, but often it's considered low as the attack path is straightforward if defenses are not robust. So, AC is likely `L`.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Often no special privileges are needed beyond what a regular user has access to through the application. Thus, PR is `N` (None).

- **User Interaction (UI):** Generally, these attacks do not require interaction from the victim once triggered, so UI is `N` (None).

- **Scope (S):** If the vulnerability affects resources beyond those managed by the compromised component, the scope is `C` (Changed). Otherwise, it's `U` (Unchanged). Path traversal usually does not change the scope as it involves accessing files within the same system.

CVE-2025-31466,"To construct a CVSS 3.1 vector for an SQL Injection vulnerability based on the provided details, we'll consider each metric:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Since this involves user input directly affecting SQL queries, it's considered local if there is no network interaction required beyond the initial access to the application.

- **Access Complexity (AC):** SQL injection often does not require complex conditions or significant effort to exploit. Thus, AC would typically be Low.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** The vulnerability can usually be exploited by an unauthenticated user or with the privileges of a regular authenticated user.

- **User Interaction (UI):** If exploitation requires some interaction from a legitimate user to provide input that leads to SQL injection, UI is considered High. Otherwise, it's Low.

- **Scope (S):** The scope is likely unchanged if exploiting the vulnerability does not impact other resources or security contexts within the application.

- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) impacts:** These depend on what data can be accessed, modified, or how availability might be impacted. Typically:
  - C: High if sensitive data like personal information is accessible.
  - I: High if data integrity can be compromised by unauthorized updates/insertions/deletions.
  - A: Low to None unless the injection results in denial-of-service conditions.

CVE-2025-31468,"To generate a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), we need to evaluate various metrics based on available information and typical characteristics of XSS vulnerabilities. Here's an attempt at filling out the CVSS 3.1 vector format:

- **AV (Attack Vector)**: Reflects how the attacker must deliver their payload. For XSS, it typically involves user interaction, so AV is `N` (Network).
  
- **AC (Attack Complexity)**: For XSS, exploiting it generally requires low complexity as the attack can be automated and doesn't need significant steps beyond delivering the payload, thus AC is `L` (Low).

- **PR (Privileges Required)**: Most XSS vulnerabilities do not require special privileges to exploit. Therefore, PR is `N` (None).

- **UI (User Interaction)**: XSS often requires user interaction to be effective as it relies on users visiting a maliciously crafted page or clicking a link. Thus, UI is `R` (Required).

- **S (Scope)**: XSS vulnerabilities typically affect the same security context in which they are exploited, so S is `U` (Unchanged).

- **C (Confidentiality Impact)**: XSS can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information like session cookies or other data. Therefore, C is `H` (High).

- **I (Integrity Impact)**: The attack could modify or delete user data on the web application. Thus, I is `H` (High).

- **A (Availability Impact)**: XSS typically does not impact availability directly unless it leads to further exploits. So, A is generally `N` (None).

Based on the information provided:

- **Access Vector (AV):** The vulnerability is likely exploitable over a network or via an application interface. Assuming it's not strictly local, we'll use `AV:N` (Network).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** SQL injection vulnerabilities typically require some level of skill and knowledge to exploit, so `AC:H` (High) is appropriate.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** The vulnerability doesn't specify needing any special privileges beyond what an attacker can achieve through the application interface. Thus, we use `PR:N` (None).

- **User Interaction (UI):** Exploiting SQL injection often requires some form of user input or interaction to trigger the vulnerability. Therefore, `UI:R` (Required) is suitable.

- **Scope (S):** This depends on whether exploitation can affect resources beyond those intended by the attacker's privileges. If exploiting this could impact other users or systems beyond the application itself, we use `S:C` (Changed). Otherwise, it would be `S:U` (Unchanged).

- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A):** SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access and modification of data, affecting confidentiality and integrity. If the attack can disrupt service availability, that should also be considered. We'll assume high impact on confidentiality and integrity with potential for availability impact: `C:H`, `I:H`, `A:L` (Low).

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network - The application is likely accessible over a network where attackers can send malicious inputs.

- **Access Complexity (AC):** Low - SQL injection vulnerabilities are typically exploitable with minimal effort, as they often involve manipulating user input fields that the application does not properly sanitize.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** None - Exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability usually doesn't require any special privileges on the server or database.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Required - The attacker needs to interact with the application, typically through a web interface, to inject malicious SQL commands.

- **Scope (S):** Unchanged - The impact is confined to the vulnerable component itself, not affecting other components of the system.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** High - An attacker could potentially access sensitive data within the database.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  Generally considered ""Low"" (AC:L) since executing an attack often only requires user action and the right input at the right time.

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  An attacker does not need to have any privileges on the system, so it is ""None"" (PR:N).

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  User interaction is required for an XSS attack to succeed, thus ""Required"" (UI:R).

- **Scope (S):**  
  The impact remains within the same security context as that of the vulnerable component; hence it's ""Unchanged"" (S:U).

- **Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), and Availability Impact (A):**

  - If sensitive data such as session cookies are accessed, there could be a high confidentiality impact (C:H).
  - If the attacker can modify user data or execute scripts that alter functionality without permission, integrity can also be impacted (I:H).
  - Availability might not be affected directly by typical XSS exploits unless they lead to broader disruptions.

CVE-2025-31564,"To provide a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score for an SQL Injection vulnerability based on your description, we must assess several components:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: Given that this is likely to be exploitable over a network by sending malicious input through user-supplied data, the most appropriate choice would be Network (N).
  
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack complexity for SQL Injection vulnerabilities is generally Low (L) because they often exploit predictable weaknesses in code.

- **Privileges Required (PR)**: Assuming that no special privileges are needed to execute the input from a user, Privilege Not Required (N) would be appropriate.

- **User Interaction (UI)**: If the exploitation can occur without any further interaction beyond providing malicious input (e.g., through a form submission), User Interaction (U) is applicable. Otherwise, it could be No User Interaction (N).

- **Scope (S)**: An SQL Injection can potentially affect more than just one component of the application if it exploits certain database privileges or interactions between components, indicating Changed Scope (C). If not, then Unchanged Scope (U) would apply.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C)**: Since unauthorized access to data could occur through an SQL Injection attack, Confidentiality is likely affected, so High (H).

- **Integrity Impact (I)**: Unauthorized modifications to the database are possible with such vulnerabilities, leading to a High (H) impact on integrity.

- **Availability Impact (A)**: If the attack can cause denial of service or data corruption that makes the application unavailable or unusable, Availability could be considered as having a High (H) impact. Otherwise, it might be Low (L) if availability is not significantly affected.

CVE-2025-31592,"To map the described vulnerabilities to a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 3.1 vector, we'll consider typical attributes for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: XSS is typically exploited remotely via web requests, so AV:X (Exploitation requires access to the target system from a network).
  
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Often considered Low (AC:L) because exploiting XSS usually involves straightforward manipulation of inputs or URLs.

- **Privileges Required (PR)**: No special privileges are needed to exploit XSS vulnerabilities, so PR:N (No privileges required).

- **User Interaction (UI)**: XSS can be exploited without user interaction if the payload is automatically executed by a victim's browser. Thus, UI:R (Required), assuming the attack needs some form of triggering.

- **Scope (S)**: XSS typically affects only the same component or process that handles the input/output, so S:N (Unchanged).

- **Confidentiality Impact (C)**: Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information in a user's session, thus C:H (High).

- **Integrity Impact (I)**: Scripts can alter content on the page, potentially changing data, leading to I:H (High).

- **Availability Impact (A)**: XSS usually doesn't directly impact availability unless it leads to a Denial of Service attack through other mechanisms. Typically, A:N (None).

Given these considerations, the CVSS 3.1 vector for XSS vulnerabilities would be:

`CVSS:3.1/AV:X/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:N/C:H/I:H/A:N`"
CVE-2025-31593,"To determine a CVSS score for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities as described in your context, we need to consider typical values used for such types of vulnerabilities. Here's how it might look based on common interpretations:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: This measures the context by which an attacker can exploit the vulnerability. For XSS, this is usually `AV:N` because the attack does not require any special conditions and typically occurs via a user interface.

- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: This refers to the level of complexity involved in exploiting the vulnerability. For XSS, the complexity is often considered `LOW`, so `AC:L`.

- **Privileges Required (PR)**: This indicates whether the attacker needs elevated privileges. Typically for XSS, no special privileges are needed beyond those available to an end-user, hence `PR:N`.

- **User Interaction (UI)**: Indicates whether the attack requires any form of user interaction. For reflected XSS vulnerabilities where a victim is tricked into clicking or interacting with a malicious link, this would be `UI:R`. However, if it's stored XSS which automatically executes upon visiting a page, it could be `UI:N`.

- **Scope (S)**: This measures whether the vulnerability affects resources beyond its security scope. For XSS, the impact is usually within the same scope, so `S:U` for unchanged.

- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A)**: These are metrics to measure the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability respectively.
  - **Confidentiality Impact**: Depending on what data can be accessed or manipulated, this could range from `LOW` (`C:L`) if it only reads information without permission, to `HIGH` (`C:H`) if sensitive data is disclosed.
  - **Integrity Impact**: This can be `LOW` (`I:L`) if the ability to modify data is restricted or undetected, to `HIGH` (`I:H`) if significant modification occurs.
  - **Availability Impact**: Often `N/A` for XSS since it generally doesn't impact availability. However, in extreme cases where it might lead to denial of service (e.g., through resource exhaustion), this could be considered.

A common CVSS vector string for a typical stored XSS attack with high confidentiality and integrity impacts is:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
``` 

This assumes a scenario where the XSS results in unauthorized access to sensitive information (high confidentiality) and can alter data or functionality within the application (high integrity). Adjust these values according to the specifics of your vulnerability assessment."

- **Attack Vector (AV):** N (Network) - The attack can be conducted over a network, as it involves web pages and HTTP requests that are accessible through the internet.
  
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** H (High) - While the input vectors are numerous, successful exploitation often requires precise crafting of inputs to bypass security mechanisms like input validation or output encoding.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** L (Low) - No specific privileges are required for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability; it can be done by any user who interacts with the application through a web browser.

- **User Interaction (UI):** N (None) - The exploitation does not require any interaction from users other than being present on the vulnerable page, as the attack is executed via crafted inputs in HTTP requests or URLs.

- **Scope (S):** C (Changed) - Exploitation of this vulnerability can affect resources beyond the scope of the original request, such as manipulating server-side data that impacts other users or sessions.

- **Confidentiality (C):** H (High) - Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information due to improper handling of user inputs and reflection in web pages.

- **Integrity (I):** H (High) - The integrity of the application and its data can be compromised through XSS attacks, allowing attackers to alter content or inject malicious scripts that affect how users interact with the site.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** XSS often requires some level of user interaction, such as clicking a link or submitting a form. This makes the attack complexity Low (L).

- **Privileges Required (PR):** XSS does not require privileged access to execute; it can be performed by any user who visits a malicious page. Therefore, PR is None (N).

- **User Interaction (UI):** Since user interaction like clicking or submitting data is usually required for the attack to succeed, UI is Required (R).

- **Scope (S):** XSS does not affect components beyond its base security scope; it typically affects only the same application. Hence, Scope is Unchanged (U).

- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** XSS can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data displayed on a page, so C is High (H).

- **Integrity Impact (I):** XSS can alter the content of web pages or perform actions without user consent, resulting in a high integrity impact. Thus, I is High (H).

- **Availability Impact (A):** XSS does not typically affect the availability of the application, so A is None (N).

Based on this analysis, the CVSS 3.1 vector for XSS is:

CVE-2025-31864,"To determine the appropriate Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), we need to consider the characteristics of XSS vulnerabilities:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** XSS typically requires user interaction, so it's often categorized as Local or Network depending on how the payload is delivered. However, since it generally involves a user-triggered action like clicking a link or loading a page, it's most commonly considered Local.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** XSS vulnerabilities are usually easy to exploit once the payload and vector are known, so they are often categorized as Low.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Exploiting XSS generally does not require any special privileges beyond those of an average user interacting with a web application. Therefore, it's typically categorized as None.

- **User Interaction (UI):** Since executing the payload usually requires some form of interaction from the victim (e.g., clicking a link or visiting a page), this is categorized as Required.

- **Scope (S):** XSS vulnerabilities often affect only one component at a time and do not require higher privileges to exploit different components. Therefore, it's typically Unchanged.

- **Impact Metrics:**
  - **Confidentiality (C):** If the XSS can be used to steal data like cookies or session tokens, this is High.
  - **Integrity (I):** If the XSS can alter data on behalf of the user, this is High.
  - **Availability (A):** Typically, XSS does not impact availability directly, so it's Low.

Given these considerations, a typical CVSS vector for a reflected XSS vulnerability might look like:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
``` 

This reflects a common scenario where the attacker needs user interaction to exploit the vulnerability, but once exploited, can achieve high impact on confidentiality and integrity. Adjustments might be necessary based on specific circumstances or additional context about the vulnerability."

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** If there are no complex actions required from the attacker beyond triggering the vulnerability through standard interaction, this can be considered ""Low"".

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Most XSS attacks don't require elevated privileges to exploit because they manipulate data that is presented to users. Hence, it's usually ""None"" (N).

- **User Interaction (UI):** Since executing an XSS typically requires the user to interact with a malicious payload in some form, this is considered ""Required"" (R).

- **Scope (S):** XSS exploits occur within the same process that processes the user input and generates output. Therefore, it's usually ""Unchanged"" (U).

- **Impact on Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A):**
  - **Confidentiality (C):** If an attacker can use XSS to access sensitive data like cookies or session tokens, the impact is ""High"".

CVE-2025-32124,"To determine a CVSS score for an SQL Injection vulnerability like the one described in your query, we need to make some assumptions about certain metrics since they aren't explicitly provided. Here’s how you could construct a typical CVSS vector based on common characteristics of SQL Injection vulnerabilities:

- **AV (Attack Vector):** Assuming this is via an application where the attack can be conducted remotely and without physical access. Typically ""N"" for Network.
- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Often ""L"" (Low), as SQL injections usually require limited steps to exploit, such as submitting specially crafted input.
- **PR (Privileges Required):** Assuming no special privileges are needed by the attacker to perform this attack, hence ""N"" (None).
- **UI (User Interaction):** If an attacker can execute without user interaction beyond initial access and submission of payload, it's usually ""N"" (None).
- **S (Scope):** Typically limited to one impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability (""U""), meaning the attack does not extend beyond the compromised component.
- **C (Confidentiality Impact):** Often ""H"" (High) because sensitive data such as user information might be accessed.
- **I (Integrity Impact):** If the vulnerability allows for unauthorized modification of data, it would likely be ""H"" (High).
- **A (Availability Impact):** Generally ""N"" if there's no disruption to services or denial-of-service conditions created.

Given these assumptions, a typical CVSS vector for an SQL Injection could look like:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
``` 

This vector represents the severity and characteristics of a general SQL Injection vulnerability. Keep in mind that specific vulnerabilities might vary, so adjustments may be necessary based on more detailed information about the attack's context and environment."
CVE-2025-32125,"To determine a CVSS score for this SQL Injection vulnerability in `SQLi-001`, we must evaluate each component of the CVSS base metrics. Based on typical attributes of such vulnerabilities and available information, here is an assessment:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Local exploitation would suggest AV:P (Adjacent Network), but without more detail, it's often assumed as AV:N (Network) due to web application access.
  
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** SQL Injection typically does not require complex conditions to be met, so AC:L (Low).

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Often no specific privileges are required beyond accessing the vulnerable input, so PR:N (None).

- **User Interaction (UI):** Generally, exploitation can occur without user interaction if the vulnerability is in a publicly accessible area of an application. Thus, UI:N (None).

- **Scope (S):** If exploiting this vulnerability results in access to resources beyond those initially accessed, it’s usually S:C (Changed). Otherwise, it's S:U (Unchanged).

- **Confidentiality Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), Availability Impact (A):**
  - The potential impact on confidentiality and integrity depends on the database content. If sensitive data can be read or modified, both could be high. For availability, if operations are disrupted, this could also be high.
  - Often, SQL Injection vulnerabilities have a high impact on all three areas if they allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or denial of service.

Considering typical scenarios for such vulnerabilities and assuming high impact:

- **Confidentiality (C):** High
- **Integrity (I):** High
- **Availability (A):** High

With these evaluations, the CVSS score vector might look like this:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
```"
CVE-2025-32126,"To provide a CVSS score for SQL Injection vulnerabilities without specific details about an attack vector and other required parameters is challenging because these factors are essential to accurately determine the impact and severity. However, based on typical characteristics of such vulnerabilities, here's a general assumption:

- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (A) — assuming it can be exploited over a network.
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L) — SQL Injection is often easy to exploit if input is not properly sanitized.
- **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N) — typically, no privileges are needed by the attacker.
- **User Interaction (UI):** None (N) — usually doesn't require user interaction beyond providing input.
- **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U) — does not affect resources beyond those managed by the affected component.
- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A):** These vary based on context, but generally:
  - **Confidentiality:** High (H) if sensitive data can be accessed.
  - **Integrity:** High (H) if data modification is possible.
  - **Availability:** Low (L) unless it leads to a denial of service.

Given these assumptions:

```
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
``` 

This score reflects the potential severity and typical characteristics of SQL Injection vulnerabilities but should be adjusted based on specific context and details."

---

### Explanation of Vector Components:

- **Attack Vector (AV): N**
  - The CSRF vulnerability typically requires the attacker to trick a victim into making an unintended request, often through social engineering or other network-based methods. Therefore, the attack vector is Network (N).

- **Attack Complexity (AC): L**
  - Exploiting this type of vulnerability generally does not require significant effort beyond tricking the user into performing certain actions on their own device. Thus, it has low complexity.

- **Privileges Required (PR): N**
  - CSRF can be exploited without any special privileges since it relies on authenticated sessions that belong to users who are already authorized by the application.

- **User Interaction (UI): R**
  - User interaction is required because the attack involves tricking the user into performing actions like clicking a link or loading an image, which initiates the malicious request.

- **Scope (S): C**
  - The scope is changed (C) because the vulnerability allows the attacker to perform operations on behalf of the victim that could affect other users or data beyond just the current session's context. For example, if the victim has administrative privileges, CSRF can lead to actions affecting all users.

- **Confidentiality (C): H**
  - The confidentiality impact is high because an attacker might access sensitive information by performing operations such as viewing or altering protected resources through CSRF attacks.

- **Integrity (I): H**
  - The integrity impact is high since the attacker can modify data, perform actions on behalf of a user without their consent, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in application data.

- **Availability (A): H**
  - Availability is considered high because CSRF could be used to perform DoS attacks or other disruptive operations that affect the availability of resources for legitimate users."
