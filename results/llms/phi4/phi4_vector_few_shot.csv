**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**
   - The CVE description mentions ""Stored XSS,"" which indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited over a network through a web application.
   - Stored XSS is typically delivered via HTTP, making it a Network attack vector.
   - Therefore, AV is `N` for Network.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - XSS vulnerabilities are generally considered to have low complexity because they often require simple input manipulation without complex steps or conditions.
   - Thus, AC is `L` for Low.

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**
   - The description does not specify any need for elevated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
   - Typically, XSS can be exploited by a regular user interacting with the application.
   - Therefore, PR is `N` for None.

4. **User Interaction (UI):**
   - Since it's a Stored XSS, the malicious script is executed automatically when the affected page is viewed, without requiring any additional interaction from the victim beyond accessing the page.
   - Hence, UI is `N` for None.

5. **Scope (S):**
   - The vulnerability involves altering the state of the application and affects other components (e.g., executing scripts in the context of a different user).
   - This indicates that the scope changes from one component to another within the application.
   - Therefore, S is `C` for Changed.

6. **Confidentiality (C):**
   - XSS can be used to steal cookies or session tokens, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
   - This impacts confidentiality significantly.
   - Thus, C is `H` for High.

7. **Integrity (I):**
   - XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the user's browser, potentially modifying data and actions taken by the user.
   - This can lead to integrity violations as it affects the trustworthiness of the application.
   - Therefore, I is `H` for High.

8. **Availability (A):**
   - The description does not indicate any impact on availability or denial of service.
   - Hence, A is `N` for None.

This reasoning leads to the final CVSS vector:  
**CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N**"

**Explanation for each component:**

- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**
  - CSRF vulnerabilities are typically exploited over the network, as they rely on tricking a user into performing actions via HTTP requests. This involves exploiting web applications accessed through networks.

- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**
  - The complexity of executing a CSRF attack is generally low because it relies on social engineering rather than technical barriers. An attacker just needs to craft malicious links or forms for users to interact with, making the attack relatively straightforward.

- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**
  - CSRF attacks do not require any special privileges beyond those of a typical user. They exploit sessions where users are already authenticated.

- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**
  - While some CSRF attacks might need user interaction to be effective, modern implementations often involve automated requests or can even be embedded in social media posts or emails that the victim clicks on without realizing it.

- **Scope (S): Changed (C)**
  - The impact of a successful CSRF attack is usually limited to actions performed within the same session context. However, since it involves unauthorized commands being executed by the web application on behalf of the user, this changes the scope of what can be achieved through authenticated sessions.

- **Confidentiality (C): High (H)**
  - A successful CSRF attack could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive data, affecting confidentiality significantly.

- **Integrity (I): High (H)**
  - The integrity of the system is compromised as well, because an attacker can perform actions that modify or delete data without authorization.

- **Availability (A): None (N)**
  - CSRF attacks typically do not impact availability directly; they focus on unauthorized actions rather than disrupting service."

---  

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  

- **Attack Vector (AV):**  
  - The vulnerability is a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue, which occurs when input from the web is improperly neutralized during web page generation. XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploited via network interaction, such as through HTTP requests. Therefore, the attack vector is Network (N).  

- **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
  - This vulnerability involves reflected XSS, which generally has a lower complexity because it often requires only user interaction to trigger the malicious script. The attacker can craft a URL with the payload that, when visited by a user, executes the script in their browser context. Thus, the attack complexity is Low (L).  

- **Privileges Required (PR):**  
  - To exploit this vulnerability, no special privileges are required beyond what an average user would have. A simple interaction with the malicious URL suffices to trigger the XSS. Therefore, the privileges required are None (N).  

- **User Interaction (UI):**  
  - Reflected XSS typically requires user interaction because the attacker needs a victim to visit a specially crafted link or view a manipulated web page. Hence, User Interaction is Required (R).  

- **Scope (S):**  
  - The vulnerability leads to Cross-site Scripting, which affects how data confidentiality and integrity are maintained between different security contexts. Since it changes the behavior of the application across different security scopes (e.g., from a user's browser context to accessing sensitive information), the scope is Changed (C).  

- **Confidentiality (C):**  
  - XSS vulnerabilities can lead to exposure of confidential data, such as session cookies or other sensitive information that could be accessed by an attacker. This typically results in a Low (L) impact on confidentiality.  

- **Integrity (I):**  
  - The vulnerability also allows for manipulation of data integrity since it permits the injection and execution of scripts within the context of another user's session. Therefore, the impact on integrity is considered Low (L).  

- **Availability (A):**  
  - XSS vulnerabilities generally do not affect the availability of a service or application directly. The primary concern is unauthorized access to data or manipulation of content, rather than denial of service. Thus, the impact on availability is None (N).  

This reasoning aligns with typical CVSS scoring for reflected XSS vulnerabilities and follows the given CVE description's context."

CVE-2025-28880,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N  

--- 

**Reasoning:**  
- **Attack Vector (AV):** The vulnerability is related to web page generation and cross-site scripting, typically executed over the network through a user's browser. Thus, it is classified as Network (N).
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Given that reflected XSS vulnerabilities are often exploitable with simple crafted inputs in web requests without additional complexities, the attack complexity is Low (L).
- **Privileges Required (PR):** This vulnerability can be exploited without needing special privileges on the affected system, so it's None (N).
- **User Interaction (UI):** The exploitation typically requires user interaction to visit a malicious link or website where the XSS payload is delivered. Therefore, User Interaction is Required (R).
- **Scope (S):** This type of vulnerability usually affects the confidentiality and integrity of data processed by a single application instance without affecting other components or instances; thus, the scope remains Unchanged (U).
- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A):** Reflected XSS primarily impacts confidentiality and integrity due to potential exposure of sensitive information or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user. There is no direct impact on availability as it does not typically lead to denial of service, so both Confidentiality and Integrity are Low (L), and Availability is None (N)."

### Analysis of CVE-2025-28886:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** 
   - The vulnerability is described as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in a REST API, which implies that it can be exploited over the network when users are authenticated on the target application.
   - Therefore, `AV:N` (Network).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - CSRF vulnerabilities typically require minimal complexity to exploit because they leverage user interactions with trusted web pages.
   - Hence, `AC:L` (Low).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**
   - The attack can be executed without needing specific privileges beyond what the user already has when authenticated on the target application.
   - Thus, `PR:N` (None).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**
   - CSRF exploits rely on user interaction to initiate requests from a trusted site, but this does not require any additional input or action by the victim apart from being logged in and visiting a malicious page.
   - So, `UI:N` (None).

5. **Scope (S):**
   - The impact of exploiting this vulnerability affects resources beyond those of the vulnerable component itself, such as user session data or other authenticated actions.
   - Therefore, `S:C` (Changed).

6. **Confidentiality (C):**
   - A successful CSRF attack can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user, potentially accessing confidential information or changing sensitive settings.
   - This warrants a high impact on confidentiality, so `C:H` (High).

7. **Integrity (I):**
   - While integrity may be affected if the attacker modifies data, CSRF is primarily about performing actions rather than altering data integrity directly.
   - Therefore, we assume `I:N` (None) unless there's specific evidence to suggest otherwise.

8. **Availability (A):**
   - The attack does not typically result in denial of service or affect availability.
   - Hence, `A:N` (None). 

This analysis results in the CVSS vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N`."

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** The attack can be executed remotely via the PayPal platform without any physical or local access to the system. Therefore, the Attack Vector is Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):** The vulnerability can be exploited with minimal complexity as it involves modifying the item quantity in a shopping cart during an online transaction process. Thus, the Attack Complexity is Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):** An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability; they only need access to modify their own shopping cart. Therefore, Privileges Required is None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):** The attack can be automated without requiring user interaction beyond the initial setup by an attacker (e.g., modifying the quantity). Hence, User Interaction is None (N).

5. **Scope (S):** This vulnerability affects the integrity of payment processing and involves a change in the state of another component (i.e., PayPal's handling of payment amounts), indicating that the Scope is Changed (C).

6. **Confidentiality (C):** The vulnerability does not directly impact confidentiality as it doesn't involve unauthorized access to data. However, financial transactions are involved, so there might be indirect impacts on confidential business information due to fraud potential. Nevertheless, in terms of direct data exposure, Confidentiality is None (N).

7. **Integrity (I):** The integrity of the payment processing system is compromised as attackers can manipulate payment amounts. Therefore, Integrity is High (H) because it affects financial transactions and trustworthiness.

8. **Availability (A):** While availability might not be directly impacted by this specific vulnerability, business operations could suffer due to financial losses from underpaid orders. However, since the system remains operational, Availability is considered None (N). But considering potential indirect impacts on business continuity, we consider it High (H).

Thus, the CVSS vector for CVE-2025-29788 is:

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**
   - The vulnerability is related to a REST API, which typically allows remote access over the network.
   - Therefore, the attack vector is Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - Since the issue involves improper enforcement of read permissions, it suggests that exploiting this flaw does not require any additional complex conditions or configurations beyond accessing the API.
   - Hence, the attack complexity is Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**
   - The description implies that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing special privileges beyond those required to interact with the REST API.
   - Thus, no specific privileges are required, which means Privileges Required is None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**
   - There's no mention of requiring user interaction for exploiting the vulnerability, indicating it can be exploited automatically.
   - Therefore, User Interaction is None (N).

5. **Scope (S):**

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** 
   - The vulnerability involves sending a local reply to an external server, suggesting that the attacker can trigger this from within the application environment. This implies that physical or direct access is not necessary, but rather access through the network stack of the application itself.
   - Thus, the attack vector is Local (L).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - The description indicates a specific scenario where a websocket handshake failure can cause the crash. Given that this requires knowledge of the system's internal workings and how to trigger such failures, it suggests a certain level of complexity.
   - However, since it involves manipulating known conditions within the application, it is not overly complex or requiring uncommon conditions beyond what an attacker might expect in testing scenarios.
   - Therefore, Attack Complexity is Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**
   - The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a local reply from the Envoy process itself without needing elevated privileges or specific permissions beyond those of running the service.
   - Hence, no additional privileges are required, making it None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**
   - There is no indication that user interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The crash can be triggered programmatically by manipulating network conditions.
   - Therefore, User Interaction is None (N).

5. **Scope (S):**
   - The scope is unchanged because the exploitation of this vulnerability does not lead to escalation or affect other components beyond those directly related to Envoy's functionality.
   - Thus, Scope is Unchanged (U).

6. **Confidentiality Impact (C):**
   - The crash itself does not inherently expose confidential data; it merely causes a denial-of-service condition.
   - Therefore, the impact on Confidentiality is None (N).

7. **Integrity Impact (I):**
   - Similar to confidentiality, there is no direct manipulation or corruption of data integrity as part of this vulnerability's exploitation.
   - Thus, Integrity impact is None (N).

8. **Availability Impact (A):**
   - The primary consequence of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the Envoy service, leading to a denial of service for users relying on it.
   - This represents a High (H) impact on Availability.

By considering these factors, we arrive at the CVSS vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`."

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**
   - The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which typically occurs over the network as an attacker tricks a victim's browser into making requests to a web application where they are authenticated.
   - Therefore, AV = Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - CSRF vulnerabilities generally have low complexity because they exploit the trust a website has in a user's browser.
   - Thus, AC = Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**
   - For CSRF attacks, no additional privileges are needed beyond those of the victim's current session on the web application.
   - Hence, PR = None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**
   - The attack typically requires some form of user interaction to be successful, such as clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised site.
   - Therefore, UI = Required (R).

5. **Scope (S):**
   - CSRF attacks do not change the scope; they exploit existing sessions and actions within the same application context.
   - Thus, S = Unchanged (U).

6. **Confidentiality (C):**
   - The primary impact of a CSRF is typically on unauthorized actions being performed with user privileges, which can lead to data exposure or manipulation.
   - Therefore, C = High (H) due to the potential for sensitive information access or modification.

7. **Integrity (I):**
   - While CSRF can affect integrity by allowing unauthorized changes, it primarily impacts confidentiality and availability more directly.
   - Thus, I = None (N).

8. **Availability (A):**
   - A CSRF attack does not typically impact the availability of a service or application.
   - Hence, A = None (N)."

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**  
   - The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in a web application, which means it can be exploited over the network by sending malicious data to an unsuspecting user.
   - Therefore, AV = Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**  
   - XSS vulnerabilities are typically considered low complexity because they often require only crafted input that is submitted through standard interfaces.
   - Thus, AC = Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**  
   - This Stored XSS does not require any specific privileges beyond what an attacker can obtain by exploiting the vulnerability (e.g., user interaction with a malicious page).
   - Therefore, PR = None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - For a stored XSS attack to succeed, there typically needs to be some form of user interaction with the compromised content.
   - Thus, UI = Required (R).

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - XSS vulnerabilities generally do not change the scope of access within the application itself; they exploit existing trust relationships between users and browsers.
   - Therefore, S = Unchanged (U).

6. **Confidentiality Impact (C):**  
   - A successful XSS attack can result in unauthorized reading of user data or session tokens, affecting confidentiality.
   - Hence, C = Low (L).

7. **Integrity Impact (I):**  
   - Similarly, integrity is affected because an attacker could alter the content displayed to a victim.
   - Therefore, I = Low (L).

8. **Availability Impact (A):**  
   - Typically, XSS does not directly affect availability as it doesn't prevent services from being used.
   - Thus, A = None (N)."

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**
   - The description mentions a ""Stored XSS"" vulnerability, which typically occurs when malicious scripts are injected and later retrieved from the server.
   - This requires interaction with the web application over the network, thus it is classified as Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - Stored XSS vulnerabilities usually have low complexity because they exploit predictable flaws in input handling.
   - Therefore, the attack complexity is Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**
   - The vulnerability does not require any special privileges to be exploited; an attacker can leverage it without needing elevated access.
   - Hence, Privileges Required is None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**
   - In the case of Stored XSS, user interaction is typically required because the malicious script needs to be triggered by a victim visiting the compromised page.
   - However, since this is a stored vulnerability, the exploit can occur without additional interaction from the user after it's set up, so User Interaction is None (N).

5. **Scope (S):**
   - Stored XSS affects both confidentiality and integrity within the same request context because it allows data to be sent to users other than those intended.
   - This changes the scope of the impact beyond just a single functionality or component, thus Scope is Changed (C).

   - Therefore, Privileges Required is None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**  
   - For a stored XSS vulnerability, once the malicious content is injected and saved on the server, no further interaction from the victim is needed beyond accessing the vulnerable webpage.
   - Thus, User Interaction is None (N).

5. **Scope (S):**  
   - This is an XSS issue affecting only the confidentiality and integrity of the user's session or data without changing how the application itself functions in terms of security boundaries.
   - The scope remains Unchanged (U) because the vulnerability does not impact other components or change the access level to resources beyond the current execution environment.

6. **Confidentiality (C):**  
   - XSS vulnerabilities can be used to steal session cookies, tokens, or other sensitive information, leading to a high confidentiality impact.
   - Therefore, Confidentiality is High (H).

7. **Integrity (I):**  
   - The malicious script can alter the content viewed by users, potentially changing data and actions they perform, impacting the integrity of interactions on the web page.
   - Thus, Integrity is High (H).

**Reasoning:**

- **AV (Attack Vector): N**
  - The vulnerability is a Stored XSS, which means it can be triggered via a web page. This typically involves the network, so we use Network (N).

- **AC (Attack Complexity): L**
  - Stored XSS vulnerabilities generally have low complexity because they exploit predictable behavior in how input is processed and displayed.

- **PR (Privileges Required): N**
  - No specific privileges are required to exploit a stored XSS vulnerability; an attacker can simply inject the payload via user input mechanisms.

- **UI (User Interaction): N**
  - Stored XSS does not require any interaction from the victim after the payload is executed. The script runs automatically when the page loads.

- **S (Scope): C**
  - The scope is changed because a stored XSS typically affects the data confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application session or user context.

- **C (Confidentiality): L**
  - Stored XSS can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information in the user's browser context, so it has low impact on confidentiality.

- **I (Integrity): L**
  - The integrity is impacted because stored XSS allows attackers to execute scripts that can alter data or actions within the application from a user's perspective.

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):** 
   - The CVE description mentions a Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in a web application. This means the attack can be performed remotely over the network, so AV is Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - Typically, exploiting XSS vulnerabilities does not require significant complexity beyond delivering the malicious payload. Therefore, AC is Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**
   - Since it's a Stored XSS vulnerability, once the malicious input is stored on the server, it can be executed without any additional privileges. Thus, PR is None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**
   - In the case of Stored XSS, user interaction is not required to trigger the payload because the malicious script executes automatically when the affected page is viewed. Hence, UI is None (N).

5. **Scope (S):**
   - This vulnerability does not change the scope of the attack within the application itself but rather exploits the web application's interface with its users. Therefore, S is Unchanged (U).

6. **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A):**
   - XSS vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to execute scripts in the context of a user's session, potentially accessing confidential information or modifying data integrity without affecting availability directly. Thus:
     - Confidentiality (C) is Low (L).
     - Integrity (I) is Low (L).
     - Availability (A) is None (N), as XSS does not generally impact system availability.

These assessments lead to the CVSS vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N`."

---

**Reasoning for each component of the CVSS Vector:**

- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**
  - The vulnerability involves Cross-site Scripting (XSS), which is exploitable over a network by an attacker through user interaction with maliciously crafted web content. This typically means that the attack can occur remotely, thus AV:N.

- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**
  - XSS vulnerabilities are generally considered low complexity because they often involve simply injecting and executing code in the context of another user's browser session. There aren't usually complex or extensive prerequisites beyond crafting a malicious script.

- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**
  - Stored XSS typically does not require any special privileges on the server side, as it involves exploiting vulnerabilities directly at the web application level that impact how input is processed and rendered to users. An attacker can exploit this without needing elevated permissions.

- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**
  - Although stored XSS requires an initial visit to a compromised page by a user, the vector in CVSS terms doesn't count these interactions as 'user interaction' in its context. It's assumed that the vulnerability is exploitable via automatic means after the payload has been stored.

- **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**
  - Stored XSS does not change the security context within which it operates; it exploits the same user session that initiated the request to execute scripts, thus remaining unchanged in scope.

- **Confidentiality (C): Low (L)**
  - Stored XSS can be used to access sensitive information displayed on a web page or manipulate it for an attacker's benefit, potentially affecting the confidentiality of data processed by the application. This typically warrants a low rating since the impact is limited to what’s visible within that context.

- **Integrity (I): None (N)**
  - While stored XSS can alter how information is displayed or add unauthorized content, it doesn't directly change the underlying data in the backend systems where integrity would be compromised. It affects only the presentation layer.

- **Availability (A): None (N)**
  - This vulnerability does not typically affect the availability of services provided by the application, as stored XSS attacks do not usually result in a denial-of-service condition or disruption of service operations."

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Attack Vector (AV):**
   - The CVE description mentions a ""Stored XSS"" vulnerability, which is typically exploited through a web application interface.
   - Stored XSS vulnerabilities are usually executed when an attacker injects malicious scripts into content that other users view.
   - Since this can occur over the network via standard HTTP(S) requests to access the stored script, the Attack Vector (AV) is classified as Network (N).

2. **Attack Complexity (AC):**
   - Stored XSS vulnerabilities often require specific conditions such as a user visiting a compromised web page, but they do not generally involve complex steps beyond the initial injection.
   - Thus, the complexity of exploiting this vulnerability is considered Low (L).

3. **Privileges Required (PR):**
   - The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit a Stored XSS; they only need to be able to submit input that gets stored and executed later.
   - Therefore, Privileges Required (PR) is None (N).

4. **User Interaction (UI):**
   - For the vulnerability to affect users, they must visit or interact with the compromised content where the malicious script resides.
   - Hence, User Interaction (UI) is Required (R).

5. **Scope (S):**
   - Since this is a Stored XSS, it affects more than just the originally targeted resource; it can impact other users who access that page.
   - Therefore, the Scope (S) is Changed (C), as the vulnerability impacts multiple resources.

6. **Confidentiality Impact (C):**
   - The malicious script could potentially read sensitive information from the user's browser session or prompt them to disclose confidential data.
   - Thus, there is a Low (L) impact on Confidentiality.

7. **Integrity Impact (I):**
   - XSS can alter the content displayed to users or perform actions without their consent, leading to integrity issues.
   - Therefore, the Integrity impact (I) is also considered Low (L).

8. **Availability Impact (A):**
   - Stored XSS typically does not affect the availability of the application itself; it impacts how data is processed and displayed.
   - Hence, there is No (N) direct impact on Availability.

**Explanation of Vector Components for CVE-2025-31456:**

- **AV (Attack Vector): N (Network)**
  - CSRF vulnerabilities typically exploit the user's browser to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user via network requests. This suggests an attack vector over the network.

- **AC (Attack Complexity): L (Low)**
  - CSRF attacks are generally straightforward and do not require complex conditions or circumventing specific security mechanisms, resulting in low complexity.

- **PR (Privileges Required): N (None)**
  - The attacker does not need to authenticate as a user to exploit CSRF vulnerabilities; the attack is possible with just the victim's browser being used while they are authenticated.

- **UI (User Interaction): R (Required)**
  - For a CSRF attack to succeed, some level of user interaction is typically needed. For example, the user might be tricked into visiting a malicious site or clicking a link that initiates an unauthorized action.

- **S (Scope): U (Unchanged)**
  - A CSRF vulnerability does not generally affect other components beyond the scope of a single request, so it doesn't change the security state or access rights outside of the immediate interaction.

- **C (Confidentiality): L (Low)**
  - The impact on confidentiality is low because the primary concern with CSRF is unauthorized actions rather than data disclosure. However, if those actions include accessing sensitive information, the impact could be higher.

- **I (Integrity): N (None)**
  - Typically, CSRF attacks do not modify or alter data integrity directly; they usually cause unintended actions to occur without changing existing data states.

- **A (Availability): N (None)**
  - CSRF generally does not impact system availability. It causes unauthorized actions rather than causing a denial of service or making resources unavailable."

CVE-2025-31614,"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

--- 

**Explanation of the Vector Components:**

- **AV (Attack Vector): A**
  - The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, which typically requires user interaction to trigger (e.g., accessing a compromised page). However, since it's stored XSS, once the payload is injected into the application, it can execute on subsequent visits without further action from an attacker. This makes it possible for an automated script to exploit it by visiting the site, thus ""Adjacent"" vector could be considered. Nevertheless, due to its web-based nature and persistence until removed, **A** (Access) might be more appropriate.

- **AC (Attack Complexity): L**
  - Attack complexity is low because exploiting a stored XSS vulnerability typically does not require intricate steps beyond injecting the payload into the application and accessing it later.

- **PR (Privileges Required): N**
  - No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, as an attacker can simply submit malicious input that gets stored and executed.

- **UI (User Interaction): N**
  - Although the attack relies on a user visiting a compromised page, from the perspective of the attacker's script or automated tool, no additional interaction is needed after the payload is in place. However, since it involves some level of interaction for execution, it might be considered as **R** (Required) if strictly analyzing an end-user context.

- **S (Scope): C**
  - The scope is changed because a successful exploitation can affect another security group or impact beyond the initial user's session, potentially impacting other users accessing the same application resources.

- **C (Confidentiality): H**
  - Confidentiality is high because stored XSS can lead to exposure of sensitive information from the browser, such as cookies, session tokens, etc., which can be accessed by an attacker.

- **I (Integrity): H**
  - Integrity is high due to the potential for executing arbitrary scripts that can alter data or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

- **A (Availability): N**
  - Availability impact is none because stored XSS does not directly affect the availability of the application or its resources."

- **Privileges Required (PR)**: The description does not specify any need for elevated privileges beyond what an attacker might already have when interacting with the application as a normal user. Therefore, PR:N (None).  

- **User Interaction (UI)**: Stored XSS typically requires no additional interaction from users to execute once the malicious script is stored and delivered by the server. Thus, UI:N (None) applies here.  

- **Scope (S)**: The vulnerability allows for a cross-site scripting attack which can affect user data integrity and confidentiality across different sessions or contexts within the application. This indicates a change in scope, so S:C (Changed).  

- **Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A)**:  
  - Stored XSS can lead to unauthorized disclosure of information (Confidentiality) and modification of data (Integrity) by executing scripts that access sensitive data or modify it. Therefore, C:L (Low) and I:L (Low).  
  - There is no mention of denial-of-service effects directly attributable to this vulnerability, so A:N (None).

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Given that retrieving embedded sensitive data from logs is not inherently complex and could potentially be automated with scripts, we select ""Low"" (L) for attack complexity.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** The description does not specify any special privileges required to access the log files. Thus, we assume it can be done without additional privileges, choosing ""None"" (N).

- **User Interaction (UI):** There is no indication that user interaction is needed beyond executing a script or program to exploit this vulnerability, so we select ""None"" (N).

- **Scope (S):** Since the vulnerability deals with accessing data within log files and does not involve changing how other components interact, the scope remains unchanged. Therefore, ""Unchanged"" (U) is appropriate.

- **Confidentiality (C):** The core issue here involves sensitive information being exposed through logs. This directly affects confidentiality, so we select ""High"" (H).

- **Integrity (I):** There is no indication that the integrity of the system or data is compromised by this vulnerability; thus, we choose ""None"" (N).

**Explanation of Components:**

- **AV (Attack Vector): N**  
  The attack is conducted over the network since it involves a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on a web page.

- **AC (Attack Complexity): L**  
  XSS vulnerabilities are typically considered to have low complexity because they can often be exploited with simple payloads and without intricate knowledge or conditions.

- **PR (Privileges Required): N**  
  No special privileges are required for exploiting an XSS vulnerability; it usually requires only the ability to submit input to a vulnerable application, which can be done by any user interacting with the web page.

- **UI (User Interaction): N**  
  The attack does not require additional user interaction beyond what is already needed to trigger the vulnerability (e.g., visiting a webpage). 

- **S (Scope): C**  
  The scope is changed because the vulnerability allows for potential data access or modification outside of the originally intended privilege level, especially in stored XSS scenarios.

- **C (Confidentiality): H**  
  Stored XSS can lead to high confidentiality impacts by allowing attackers to steal sensitive information from users' sessions or cookies.

- **I (Integrity): H**  
  The integrity impact is high because attackers can inject malicious scripts that alter the content of a user's web session, manipulate data, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

- **A (Availability): H**  
  While availability might not be directly impacted by XSS itself, it can lead to significant disruptions if used as part of larger attacks (e.g., defacement), leading to high availability impact. However, in stored XSS scenarios, the focus is typically more on confidentiality and integrity. 

This vector reflects a typical stored XSS vulnerability with potential severe impacts due to its nature and scope."

**Explanation of the Vector Components:**

- **AV (Attack Vector):** The vulnerability is a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue, which typically allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can usually be done remotely via the network, hence **N** for Network.

- **AC (Attack Complexity):** XSS vulnerabilities are generally considered low complexity because they often require only a crafted input that is directly executed in the context of the application. Thus, **L** for Low.

- **PR (Privileges Required):** The attack does not require any special privileges to be successful; it can be performed by an unauthenticated user who visits a maliciously crafted web page. Therefore, **N** for None.

- **UI (User Interaction):** This is a Stored XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server and executed without requiring further action from the victim after the initial visit to the compromised site. Thus, **N** for None.

- **S (Scope):** Since this is an XSS vulnerability affecting data integrity and confidentiality across different users or sessions, the scope of the impact changes, so **C** for Changed.

- **C (Confidentiality):** The attacker can potentially access sensitive information from other users' sessions, such as session tokens. Therefore, **L** for Low.

- **I (Integrity):** The attacker can alter data or perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent, impacting data integrity. Hence, **L** for Low.

- **A (Availability):** While XSS typically does not directly impact availability, in some cases it might be used to degrade service indirectly, but generally, it is considered non-applicable here, so **N** for None."

CVE-2025-31895,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N  

---  

**Explanation of Vector Components for CVE-2025-31895:**  

- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**  
  The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which can be exploited via the network when an attacker manipulates data that gets reflected in a web page generated by the application. This fits the definition of a network attack vector because it involves interaction over the network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**  
  XSS vulnerabilities are generally considered to have low complexity as they often require minimal effort and technical knowledge to exploit, particularly when stored XSS is involved since it does not necessitate tricking the user into taking further action beyond accessing a compromised page.

- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**  
  Stored XSS typically does not require any special privileges from the perspective of an attacker. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability without needing to have access rights or specific permissions within the system, as they rely on existing vulnerabilities in data processing and rendering.

- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**  
  In stored XSS scenarios, user interaction beyond initial access is not required because the malicious script is executed automatically when a victim accesses the compromised page. This distinguishes it from reflected XSS which would require some form of tricking a victim to click a link.

- **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**  
  The scope remains unchanged in this context, as the vulnerability does not allow an attacker to escalate privileges or access additional resources beyond what was originally compromised.

- **Confidentiality (C): High (H)**  
  XSS vulnerabilities can lead to high confidentiality impact because they may enable attackers to execute scripts in a user's browser session, potentially accessing sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and other data exposed by the application.

- **Integrity (I): None (N)**  
  This specific XSS vulnerability does not inherently allow attackers to alter data or compromise system integrity directly. It primarily enables unauthorized actions within the context of a user's session rather than altering stored data.

- **Availability (A): None (N)**  
  The vulnerability does not affect availability, as it doesn't typically lead to service disruptions like denial-of-service attacks would; its primary impact is on confidentiality and potentially user interaction.

  The vulnerability allows exploitation over the network, as it involves incorrect configuration in a plugin accessible via a web interface. This suggests remote access is possible without needing direct physical or local connections.

- **Attack Complexity (AC): L (Low)**  
  Given that the vulnerability results from missing authorization checks due to misconfiguration, exploiting this issue does not require complex steps beyond typical network interaction with the affected application.

- **Privileges Required (PR): N (None)**  
  An attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any prior privileges. The absence of proper access controls means no specific user permissions are needed.

- **User Interaction (UI): N (None)**  
  This vulnerability does not require any interaction from a user beyond initiating the attack, such as sending requests to trigger the misconfigured access control behavior.

- **Scope (S): C (Changed)**  
  The impact of exploiting this vulnerability affects more than just confidentiality. It can potentially alter data integrity and availability, thus changing the security state for other components or users within the system.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C): H (High)**  
  Exploiting incorrect access control could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to a high impact on confidentiality.

- **Integrity Impact (I): N (None)**  
  There is no indication that this vulnerability allows alteration of the integrity of existing data. The primary concern is accessing unauthorized data rather than modifying it.

### Analysis:

To generate the correct CVSS 3.1 vector for CVE-2025-32162, let's break down each component of the description and align it with the CVSS metrics.

#### Attack Vector (AV):
- The vulnerability is a DOM-Based XSS issue in a web application. This type of attack occurs when an attacker manipulates the client-side script within the victim’s browser.
- **Conclusion:** Since this can be exploited over the network via a malicious URL or manipulated page, it falls under `Network (N)`.

#### Attack Complexity (AC):
- DOM-Based XSS is generally considered to have low complexity since it often requires just crafting a malicious URL or input that the application processes in an unsafe way.
- **Conclusion:** The attack complexity is `Low (L)`.

#### Privileges Required (PR):
- DOM-Based XSS typically does not require any special privileges on the server side as it exploits vulnerabilities in client-side scripts.
- **Conclusion:** No privileges are required, so this is `None (N)`.

#### User Interaction (UI):
- For DOM-Based XSS to be effective, user interaction might be necessary, such as clicking a link or visiting a page. However, if the attack can occur without any additional action from the user beyond what they would normally do (e.g., simply visiting a compromised page), it is considered `None (N)`.
- **Conclusion:** Assuming the vulnerability does not require explicit actions beyond normal browsing behavior, this is `None (N)`.

#### Scope (S):
- The impact of an XSS attack typically affects only the confidentiality and integrity of the data presented to the user without affecting the application's state or other users.
- **Conclusion:** Since it doesn't lead to a change in scope, it remains `Unchanged (U)`.

#### Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I):
- Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute scripts in the context of another user, potentially stealing data (`Confidentiality`) and altering or corrupting displayed information (`Integrity`).
- **Conclusion:** Both confidentiality and integrity are affected at a `Low (L)` level.

#### Availability (A):
- XSS does not typically disrupt the availability of the service itself; it affects what is presented to users.
- **Conclusion:** There is no impact on availability, so this is `None (N)`.

CVE-2025-32168,"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

--- 

**Reasoning for each component:**

- **AV (Attack Vector): N (Network)**  
  The CVE description mentions Stored XSS, which typically involves remote attackers sending malicious scripts to a web application that are stored and later served to users. This implies an attack vector over the network.

- **AC (Attack Complexity): L (Low)**  
  Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities often do not require complex conditions to be exploited. Therefore, the attack complexity is considered low.

- **PR (Privileges Required): N (None)**  
  Stored XSS does not typically require any special privileges on the server or application as it exploits a vulnerability in how input is processed and output is generated by the application itself.

- **UI (User Interaction): N (None)**  
  In stored XSS, the malicious script is automatically executed when the affected user accesses the page without needing further interaction from them.

- **S (Scope): C (Changed)**  
  Stored XSS can affect more than just confidentiality; it may also allow for actions that change the integrity or availability of resources (e.g., hijacking sessions).

- **C (Confidentiality): L (Low)**  
  An attacker could potentially access sensitive data through stolen session cookies or other information, so there is a low impact on confidentiality.

- **I (Integrity): L (Low)**  
  The integrity is impacted as an attacker can modify the content displayed to users or execute scripts that alter user actions without their knowledge.

- **A (Availability): N (None)**  
  Stored XSS typically does not affect availability unless it's part of a larger attack strategy, such as a DoS attack. In this case, no specific mention is made regarding impact on availability."

**Explanation of Vector Components for CVE-2025-32170:**

- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**
  - The vulnerability is related to Cross-site Scripting (XSS), which typically occurs over the network as it involves sending malicious scripts through web pages accessed via a browser.

- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**
  - XSS vulnerabilities are generally considered low complexity since they often require straightforward input manipulation without complex steps or knowledge of specific internal workings.

- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**
  - Stored XSS does not typically require any special privileges beyond what an attacker can achieve by manipulating input and causing it to be stored and executed within the application.

- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**
  - In the context of Stored XSS, once the malicious script is stored in the application (e.g., a comment or post), it executes automatically when accessed without requiring further user interaction beyond visiting the affected page.

- **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)**
  - The impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability remains within the same security context; however, Stored XSS can indirectly affect these aspects through exploitation of session cookies or redirection to malicious sites, but scope itself is not changed from the perspective of access boundaries.

- **Confidentiality (C): High (H)**
  - A successful attack could allow an attacker to steal sensitive information such as session tokens, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts and data.

- **Integrity (I): High (H)**
  - Stored XSS can also lead to manipulation of the application state or content displayed to users, potentially allowing attackers to modify data or messages seen by other users.

- **Availability (A): None (N)**
  - While XSS may disrupt user experience, it does not directly impact availability in terms of causing denial-of-service; hence, this is marked as none.  

These assessments are based on typical characteristics and impacts associated with Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities."

### Explanation:

- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)**  
  CSRF vulnerabilities are typically exploitable over the network, as they involve tricking a user into submitting a request to a vulnerable web application.

- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)**  
  CSRF attacks generally do not require complex conditions or setups; an attacker can exploit it with relatively simple means by crafting a malicious URL or script.

- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)**  
  The user does not need any special privileges to be exploited; the attack can occur when a normal user interacts with the application.

- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)**  
  CSRF exploits do not typically require direct interaction from the victim beyond visiting a malicious link or page, which can often happen without their explicit consent or knowledge.

- **Scope (S): Changed (C)**  
  Since the vulnerability affects data integrity by potentially allowing unauthorized actions to be performed on behalf of an authenticated user, it changes the scope of access.

- **Confidentiality (C): Low (L)**  
  While CSRF does not typically expose confidential information directly, it can lead to unauthorized actions that indirectly compromise confidentiality.

- **Integrity (I): None (N)**  
  The primary concern with CSRF is unauthorized actions rather than data corruption or modification, so integrity impact is generally considered none.

- **Availability (A): None (N)**  
  CSRF does not typically affect the availability of the system or application."

**Explanation of Each Component:**

- **Attack Vector (AV):** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which typically involves the network to exploit, so we use `N` for Network.

- **Attack Complexity (AC):** CSRF attacks generally have low complexity because they can be executed with standard web interactions and do not require advanced techniques, so we use `L`.

- **Privileges Required (PR):** Typically, a CSRF attack does not require any special privileges beyond what an authenticated user already has, so we use `N` for None.

- **User Interaction (UI):** CSRF exploits typically require the user to be tricked into interacting with a malicious request, so we use `N` because it assumes the victim is logged in and performing actions as usual without additional interaction.

- **Scope (S):** This vulnerability affects data outside of the affected component's scope by exploiting session or cookie information, which changes the scope, hence `C`.

- **Confidentiality (C):** CSRF can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, potentially exposing sensitive information, so we use `H` for High.

- **Integrity (I):** The integrity impact is typically None (`N`) because CSRF does not modify data but rather performs unauthorized actions.

- **Availability (A):** Availability is typically Not impacted (`N`) as CSRF does not affect the availability of the system or resources."
